PART XIX Diseases of the Blood Section 1 The Hematopoietic System 2921 HEMATOPOIESIS IN THE HUMAN EMBRYO AND FETUS Hematopoiesis is the process by which the cellular elements of blood are formed. In the developing human embryo and fetus, hematopoiesis has three developmental waves and is conceptually divided into three ana- tomic stages: mesoblastic, hepatic, and myeloid. Mesoblastic hemato- poiesis occurs in extraembryonic structures, principally in the yolk sac, and begins between the 10th and 14th days of gestation. By 6-­8 weeks of gestation, the liver replaces the yolk sac as the primary site of blood cell production, and during this time, the placenta also contributes as a hematopoietic site. By 10-­12 weeks, extraembryonic hematopoiesis has ceased. Hepatic hematopoiesis occurs through the remainder of gesta- tion and then diminishes during the second ­trimester while bone mar- row (myeloid) hematopoiesis increases. The liver is the predominant erythropoietic organ through 20-­24 weeks of gestation. Each hematopoietic organ houses distinct populations of cells. The yolk sac predominantly produces erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and macrophages. The fetal liver is primarily an erythropoietic organ, while the bone marrow produces erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and leuko- cytes. The types of leukocytes present in the fetal liver and marrow dif- fer with gestation. Macrophages precede neutrophils in the marrow, and the ratio of macrophages to neutrophils decreases as gestation progresses. Regardless of gestational age or anatomic location, produc- tion of all hematopoietic tissues begins with multipotent cells capable of both self-­renewal and clonal maturation into all blood cell lineages. Progenitor cells differentiate under the influence of transcription fac- tors and hematopoietic growth factors. The classical model of hematopoietic differentiation involves dif- ferentiation into increasingly lineage-­specific progenitors, although there may also be alternate pathways that are used separately or in combination with classical pathways (Fig. 495.1). In the classical path- way, long-­term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LTR-­HSCs) are characterized by their ability to self-­renew and differentiate into cells that are multipotent. Multipotent progenitors (MPPs) have reduced self-­renewal capacity and differentiate into common lymphoid pro- genitors (CLPs) or common myeloid progenitors (CMPs). The CMP differentiates into all the blood lineages except for lymphoid. The commitment of hematopoietic cells to increasingly lineage-­restricted cells requires cytokine stimulation and regulation by transcription factors. Erythrocytes in the fetus are larger than in adults, and at 22-­23 weeks’ gestation, the mean corpuscular volume can be as high as 135 femto- liters (fL) (Fig. 495.2A). Similarly, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin is very high at 22-­23 weeks and falls relatively linearly with advancing gestation (see Fig. 495.2B). In contrast, the mean corpuscular hemo- globin concentration is constant throughout gestation at 34 ±1 g/dL. While the size and quantity of hemoglobin in erythrocytes diminish during gestation, the hematocrit and blood hemoglobin concentration gradually increase (Fig. 495.3). Platelet concentration in the blood increases gradually between 22 and 40 weeks’ gestation (Fig. 495.4), but the platelet size, assessed by mean platelet volume, remains constant at 8 ±1 fL. No differences are observed between males and females in fetal and neonatal refer- ence ranges for erythrocyte indices, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet counts, or mean platelet volume measurements. FETAL GRANULOCYTOPOIESIS Neutrophils are first observed in the human fetus about 5 weeks after con- ception as small clusters of cells around the aorta. The fetal bone marrow space begins to develop around the eighth week, and from 8-­10 weeks, the marrow space enlarges, but no neutrophils appear there until 10.5 weeks. From 14 weeks through term, the most common granulocytic cell type in the fetal bone marrow space is the neutrophil. Neutrophils and macro- phages originate from a common progenitor cell, but macrophages appear before neutrophils in the fetus, first in the yolk sac, liver, lung, and brain, all before the bone marrow cavity is formed. Granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor (G-­CSF) and macrophage colony-­stimulating factor (M-­CSF) are expressed in developing fetal bone as early as 6 weeks after conception, and both are expressed in the fetal liver as early as 8 weeks. Granulocyte-­macrophage colony-­ stimulating factor (GM-­CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) also are distributed widely in human fetal tissues. However, no changes in expression of any of these factors, or of their specific receptors, appear to be the signal for fetal production of neutrophils or macrophages. Fetal blood contains few neutrophils until the third trimester. At 20 weeks’ gestation, the blood neutrophil count is 0-­500/mm3. Although mature neutrophils are scarce, progenitor cells with the capacity to generate neutrophil clones are abundant in fetal blood. When cultured in vitro in the presence of recombinant G-­CSF, they mature into large colonies of neutrophils. The physiologic role of G-­CSF includes upreg- ulating neutrophil production, and the low number of circulating neu- trophils in the mid-­trimester human fetus may be caused, in part, by low production of G-­CSF. Monocytes isolated from the blood of adults produce G-­CSF when stimulated with a variety of inflammatory medi- ators, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin (IL)-­1. In contrast, monocytes isolated from the blood or organs of fetuses up to 24 weeks’ gestation generate only small quantities of G-­CSF protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) after LPS or IL-­1 stimulation. Despite this, G-­CSF receptors on the surface of neutrophils of newborn infants are equal in number and affinity to those on adult neutrophils. In the fetus, actions of the granulocytic factors (G-­CSF, M-­CSF, GM-­ CSF, and SCF) are not limited to hematopoiesis.

FETAL THROMBOPOIESIS Several biologic differences exist between fetal, neonatal, and adult mega- karyopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. There is a developmentally unique pattern of fetal/neonatal megakaryopoiesis characterized by rapid prolif- eration, followed by full cytoplasmic maturation without polyploidization. Fetal and neonatal megakaryocytes are significantly smaller, exhibit lower ploidy, and produce fewer platelets. However, fetal and neonatal mega- karyocytes have a higher proliferative potential than adult progenitors. These differences allow fetuses and neonates to populate their rapidly expanding bone marrow space and blood volume while maintaining nor- mal platelet counts. Megakaryocyte progenitors are categorized as burst-­forming unit–megakaryocytes (BFU-­MK), which are primitive megakaryocyte ?

All rights reserved. 2924  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood progenitors, and colony-­forming unit–megakaryocytes (CFU-­MK), which are more differentiated. BFU-­MK produce large multifocal colonies con- taining ≥50 megakaryocytes, whereas CFU-­MK generate smaller (3-­50 cells/colony) unifocal colonies. Megakaryocytes are identified by their morphologic characteristics as they undergo endoreduplication, which results in large cells with polyploid nuclei. Megakaryocytes, unlike mega- karyocyte progenitors, do not have the capacity to generate colonies. Rather, they undergo maturation, progressing from small mononuclear cells to large polyploid cells. The modal megakaryocyte ploidy (the number of sets of complete chromosomes) in normal adult marrow is 16N. In the fetus and neonate, ploidy is lower, primarily 2N and 4N, and mature mega- karyocyte size is smaller. Large megakaryocytes generate more platelets than do small megakaryocytes; in vitro studies suggest that megakaryo- cytes of neonates produce fewer platelets than do their adult counterparts. The exact mechanisms by which megakaryocytes release platelets into the circulation remain incompletely understood. In situ examination of this process suggests that mature megakaryocytes migrate to a perivas- cular site and extend a process through the endothelium, giving rise to proplatelets, which then release platelets. An alternate mechanism is that platelets are released from megakaryocytes in the lungs as a result of shear forces. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the dominant regulator of megakaryocyte development and platelet production. TPO is predominantly produced in the liver from early fetal to adult life but is also expressed by cells in the kid- ney, and, to a lesser extent, by smooth muscle and marrow cells. TPO con- centrations are higher in healthy neonates of any gestational age than in healthy adults. TPO is a primary stimulator of megakaryocyte and platelet production, but SCF, IL-­3, IL-­11, IL-­6, and erythropoietin also stimulate megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, TPO promotes expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and pro- genitor cells, and the TPO receptor is expressed on HSCs and erythroid progenitors in addition to megakaryocyte progenitors, megakaryocytes, and mature platelets. FETAL ERYTHROPOIESIS Similar to hematopoietic production of other cell lineages, fetal eryth- ropoiesis is regulated by growth factors produced by the fetus, not by the mother. Erythropoietin (EPO) does not cross the human pla- centa. Stimulating maternal EPO production does not enhance fetal erythropoiesis, nor does suppressing maternal erythropoiesis by hypertransfusion. EPO plays a central regulatory role on the proliferation and matura- tion of erythroid progenitors. Erythroid-­committed progenitors consist of burst-­forming unit–erythroid (BFU-­E) and colony-­forming unit–ery- throid (CFU-­E) cells. In colony-­forming assays, human BFU-­E cells are more proliferative, forming colonies of multiple clusters of erythroblasts, as compared with CFU-­E cells, which form one or two clusters, with each containing 8-­100 hemoglobinized erythroblasts. EPO is essential for erythrocyte production from CFU-­E cells by inducing survival and pro- liferation of erythroblasts. EPO binds to specific receptors on the surface of committed erythroid precursors, and its expression is regulated by an oxygen-­sensing mechanism through the hypoxia-­inducible factor (HIF) family of proteins. HIF-­1α and HIF-­2α are regulated by oxygen tension, whereas HIF-­1β is constitutively expressed. Together, HIF proteins main- tain oxygen homeostasis and regulate erythropoiesis by inducing EPO under hypoxic conditions. EPO is produced by monocytes and macrophages in the fetal liver during the first and second trimesters. After birth, the anatomic site of EPO production shifts to the kidney. The specific stimulus for this shift is unknown but may involve the increase in arterial oxygen tension that occurs at birth. Epigenetic modification of gene expression may also play a role because it appears that renal and hepatic EPO genes are meth- ylated to different degrees. Although EPO mRNA and protein can be found in the human fetal kidney, it is not known whether this produc- tion is biologically relevant. It appears that renal production of EPO is not essential for normal fetal erythropoiesis, as evidenced by the normal serum EPO concentration and normal hematocrit of anephric fetuses. Hemoglobins in the Fetus and Neonate Hemoglobin is a tetramer of four globin chains with an iron-­containing porphyrin ring called heme covalently bound to each chain. A dynamic interaction between heme and globin gives hemoglobin its unique prop- erties in the reversible transport of oxygen. The hemoglobin molecule consists of two alpha (α)-­like and two beta (β)-­like polypeptide chains, with each chain having a heme group attached (Fig. 495.5). There are two β-­globin genes and four α-­globin genes. Within erythrocytes of an early embryo, fetus, child, and adult, six different hemoglobins may normally be detected (Fig. 495.6): the embryonic hemoglobins (Gower-­1, Gower-­2, and Portland), fetal hemoglobin (HbF), and the adult hemoglobins (HbA and HbA2). The electrophoretic mobilities of hemoglobins vary with their chemical structures. Expression and quantitative relationships among the hemoglobins are determined by complex developmental processes. Globin chain expres- sion is developmental stage specific and occurs through two hemoglo- bin switches, mediated primarily through changes of the β-­globin genes expressed. There are five functional β-­like globin chain genes: embryonic (HBE1), two fetal (HBG1, HBG2), and two adult (HBD, HBB); and three α-­like globin chain genes: embryonic (HBZ) and two adult (HBA1, HBA2). Primitive erythroid cells primarily express embryonic globins. The first β-­ globin switch occurs at approximately 6 weeks’ gestation to fetal globin (HBG), which coincides with the onset of definitive hematopoiesis. The major hemoglobin in the fetus (HbF) consists of two α and two gamma (γ) globin chains (α2γ2). The second globin switch is responsible for the expression of the major hemoglobin of adults (HbA), consisting of two α and two β polypeptide chains (α2β2) and is first expressed at mid-­gestation. A key regulator of the fetal-­to-­adult hemoglobin switch is the transcrip- tion factor BCL11A, which binds to the β-­globin gene and acts to silence γ-­globin expression and thus HbF. Embryonic Hemoglobins The blood of early human embryos contains two slowly migrating hemo- globins, Gower-­1 and Gower-­2, and Hb Portland, which has HbF-­like mobility. The zeta (ζ) chains of Hb Portland and Gower-­1 are structurally quite similar to α chains. Both Gower hemoglobins contain the epsilon (ε) β-­like globin polypeptide chain. Hb Gower-­1 has the structure ζ2ε2, whereas Gower-­2 has α2ε2. Hb Portland has the structure ζ2γ2. In embryos up to 6 weeks’ gestation, the Gower hemoglobins predominate but are no longer detectable by 3 months of gestation. Fetal Hemoglobin By 6-­8 weeks’ gestation, HbF (α2γ2) is the predominant hemoglobin; at 24 weeks’ gestation, it constitutes 90% of the total hemoglobin.

Chapter 495  u  Development of the Hematopoietic System  2925 declines modestly in the third trimester, such that the HbF comprises 70–80% of the total hemoglobin. HbF production decreases rapidly postnatally (Fig. 495.7), and by 6-­12 months of age declines to adult concentrations of <2%. Understanding the molecular basis of the fetal-­ to-­adult hemoglobin switch is of interest because of the therapeutic benefits to patients with β-­thalassemia and sickle cell disease, whose clinical severity is improved with modest elevation of HbF. The exact mechanisms by which BCL11A acts to repress HbF are not fully eluci- dated, but erythroid-­specific enhancers of BCL11A have been identi- fied and are potential targets for therapeutic HbF induction. Adult Hemoglobins HbA constitutes 5–10% of total hemoglobin at 24 weeks’ gestation and steadily increases, so that at term, HbA averages 30% of total hemoglo- bin. By 6-­12 months of age, individuals reach adult concentrations of HbA. The minor adult hemoglobin component, HbA2, contains delta (δ) chains and has the structure α2δ2. At birth, <1.0% of HbA2 is detected, but by 12 months of age the normal level is 2.0–3.4%. Throughout life, the normal ratio of HbA to HbA2 is approximately 30:1. Alterations of Hemoglobins HbF levels may be elevated with hemoglobinopathies, hereditary persis- tence of HbF, or bone marrow failure syndromes or may be associated with stress erythropoiesis. Because the HbF level is elevated during the first years of life, knowledge of its normal pattern of decline is important (see Figs. 495.6 and 495.7). Two disorders resulting from pathogenic variants in the β-­globin gene (HBB), β-­thalassemia and sickle cell disease, become symptomatic postnatally as fetal γ-­globin expression decreases and adult β-­globin increases. In both these disorders, elevated HbF levels persist in childhood and later. In patients with the most severe type, β0 thalassemia, except for a small amount of HbA2, HbF is the only hemoglobin produced. At the other end of the spectrum, in individuals with β-­thalassemia trait, the postnatal decrease of HbF is delayed and mildly elevated levels of HbF (>2%) may persist throughout life. Individuals with sickle cell disease, who also have a pathogenic variant in the HBB gene, typically demonstrate elevated levels of HbF, ranging from approximately 5% to up to 30%. In contrast, elevated HbF is not characteristic of α-­thalassemia syndromes, but tetramers of γ chains (γ4 or Hb Barts) may be found in the neonatal period. Because α-­globin chains are expressed in fetal and adult hemo- globin, four α gene pathogenic variants leading to functional deletions are not compatible with life. Fetuses die in utero or shortly after birth from the severe anemia and hydrops fetalis. Inheritance of only one normal gene of the four (α −/−) results in hemoglobin H disease, which is usually associ- ated with a moderate anemia. Inheritance of two or three normal α genes results in α-­thalassemia trait or carrier status, respectively. Hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) is a benign genetic condition caused by heterozygous deletions or nucleotide substitutions in regions of the β-­globin locus that regulate transcription of HBG1 and HBG2, causing persistent pancellular HbF expression levels of approximately 30% of total hemoglobins. Individuals with HPFH do not exhibit anemia. Preterm infants treated with human recombinant EPO increase HbF production during active erythropoiesis. Moderate elevations of HbF may also occur in many diseases accompanied by hematologic stress, such as hemolytic anemias, leukemia, and bone marrow failure syn- dromes, such as Diamond Blackfan anemia. The normal adult level of HbA2 (2.0–3.4%) is seldom altered. Levels of HbA2 > 3.4% are found in most persons with the β-­thalassemia trait and in those with megaloblastic anemias secondary to vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency. Decreased HbA2 levels are found in those with iron-­deficiency anemia (see Chapter 504) and α-­thalassemia (see Chapter 511.10). RED CELL LIFE SPAN IN THE FETUS AND NEONATE In general, the highest hematocrit during a person’s lifetime occurs at birth, and the lowest hematocrit occurs at the physiologic nadir that occurs 8-­10 weeks postnatally. A shortened life span of fetal and neonatal red blood cells (RBCs) has been suggested as an important component. The average erythrocyte life span in normal adults is approximately 120 days. The life span of fetal/neonatal erythrocytes was once estimated to be considerably less, with an average of 60-­90 days suggested by chromium (51Cr)-­labeled erythrocyte studies. How- ever, newer studies indicate that the life span of fetal/neonatal RBCs is similar to that of adults. Neocytolysis is the active removal of young erythrocytes that were generated in relatively hypoxic conditions, after normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. This process has also been sug- gested as an explanation for the physiologic nadir of neonates.

All rights reserved. 2926  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood Anemia is defined as a reduction of the hemoglobin concentration or red blood cell (RBC) volume below the range of values occurring in healthy persons. Normal ranges for hemoglobin and hematocrit (packed red cell volume) vary substantially with age and between males and females (Table 496.1) and by race and ethnicity (Table  496.2). Anemia is a significant global health problem affecting children and reproductive-­age females (Figs. 496.1 and 496.2). Physiologic responses to anemia include increased cardiac output, augmented oxygen extraction (increased arteriovenous oxygen dif- ference), and shunting of blood flow toward vital organs and tissues. In addition, the concentration of 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate increases within the RBC. The resultant “rightward shift” of the oxygen dissocia- tion curve reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and results in more complete transfer of oxygen to the tissues. This same shift in the oxygen dissociation curve can also occur at high altitude. Higher levels of erythropoietin (EPO) and consequent increased RBC production by the bone marrow further help the body to adapt. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A detailed history and thorough physical exam are essential when eval- uating an anemic child. Important historical facts include demograph- ics, diet, medications, chronic diseases, infections, travel, and exposures. A family history of anemia and associated difficulties (e.g., splenomeg- aly, jaundice, early-­age onset of gallstones) is also important. Often, few physical symptoms or signs result solely from a low hemoglobin, par- ticularly when the anemia develops slowly. Clinical findings generally do not become apparent until the hemoglobin level falls to <7-­8 g/dL. Clinical features can include pallor, sleepiness, irritability, and decreased exercise tolerance. Pallor can involve the tongue, nail beds, conjunctiva, palms, or palmar creases. A flow murmur is often present. Ultimately, weakness, tachypnea, shortness of breath on exertion, tachycardia, car- diac dilation, and high-­output heart failure results from increasingly severe anemia, regardless of its cause. Unusual physical findings linked to specific underlying disease etiologies are discussed in detail in sec- tions describing the associated disorders and in Table 496.3.

Chapter 496  u  Anemias  2927 LABORATORY STUDIES Initial laboratory testing should include hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC indices, white blood cell (WBC) count and differential, platelet count, reticulocyte count, and examination of the peripheral blood smear. The need for additional laboratory studies is dictated by the history, physi- cal exam, and initial testing. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Anemia can result from many underlying pathologic processes. To narrow the diagnostic possibilities, anemias may be classified based on their morphology and physiology (Fig. 496.3). Anemias may be morphologically categorized by red cell size (mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) and microscopic appearance. Anemias can be classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on whether the MCV is low, normal, or high, respectively (Table 496.4). RBC size also changes with age, and normal devel- opmental changes in MCV should be accommodated before a des- ignation is made (see Table 496.1). Examination of a peripheral blood smear often reveals changes in RBC appearance that will help to further narrow the diagnostic categories (Fig. 496.4 and Table 496.5). Details regarding morphologic changes associated with spe- cific disorders are described in subsequent sections. Anemias may also be further divided based on underlying patho- physiology. The two major categories are decreased production and increased destruction (or loss). These two groups are not always mutually exclusive. Decreased RBC production may be a consequence of either ineffective erythropoiesis or complete failure of erythropoiesis. Increased destruction or loss may be secondary to hemolysis, sequestration, or bleeding. The peripheral blood reticu- locyte percentage or absolute number helps to distinguish between the two physiologic categories. The normal reticulocyte percent- age of total RBCs during most of childhood is approximately 1%, with an absolute reticulocyte count of 25,000-­75,000/mm3. In the presence of anemia, EPO production and the absolute number of reticulocytes should rise. Low or normal numbers of reticulocytes generally represent an inadequate response to anemia that is associ- ated with relative bone marrow failure or ineffective erythropoiesis. Increased numbers of reticulocytes represent a normal bone mar- row response to ongoing RBC destruction (hemolysis), sequestra- tion, or loss (bleeding). Figure 496.3 presents a useful approach to assessing the common causes of anemia in the pediatric age group. Children with microcytic anemia and low or normal reticulocyte counts most often have defects in erythroid maturation or ineffective erythropoiesis. Iron deficiency is the most common cause (see Chapter 504). Thalassemia trait con- stitutes the primary differential diagnosis when iron deficiency is suspected (see Chapter 511). Distinctions between these entities are presented in Table 504.2. Chronic disease or inflammation (more often normocytic), lead poisoning, and sideroblastic anemias should also be considered and are discussed in other chapters. Microcytosis and elevated reticulocyte counts are associated with thalassemias and Anaemia prevalence Mild (5.0–19.9%) Moderate (20.0–39.9%) Severe (40.0%) Regression-based estimate Fig. 496.1  Global prevalence of anemia in children of preschool age (0-­5 yr).

Notably, thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies are most often seen in patients of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, African, or Asian descent. Normocytic anemia and low reticulocyte count characterize many anemias. The anemia of chronic disease/inflammation is usually normocytic (see Chapter 504). The anemia associated with renal failure, primarily a result of reduced EPO production, will invariably be associated with clinical and laboratory evidence of significant kidney disease. Decreased or absent RBC produc- tion secondary to transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (see Chapter 499), infection, medications, or endocrinopathy usually results in a normocytic anemia, as does bone marrow infiltration by malignancy. Normocytic anemia in combination with leukopenia (or significant leukocytosis with blasts) and/or thrombocytopenia should raise suspicion for malignancy. See Chapters 517 and 518 to review pancytopenias. Acute bleeding, hypersplenism, and con- genital dyserythropoietic anemia type II are also normocytic (see Chapter 501). In children with normocytic anemia and an appropriate (high) reticulocyte response, the anemia is usually caused by bleeding, hypersplenism, or ongoing hemolysis. In hemolytic conditions, reticulocytosis, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and increased serum lactate dehydrogenase are indicators of accelerated erythrocyte destruction. Many causes of hemolysis result from conditions that are extrinsic (usually acquired) or intrinsic (usually congenital) to the erythrocyte. Abnormal RBC morphology (e.g., spherocytes, dacryocytes or sickle forms, and schistocytes) identified on the peripheral smear is often helpful in ascertaining the cause. The anemia seen in children with macrocytic blood cells is sometimes megaloblastic, resulting from impaired DNA synthesis and nuclear development (see Chapter 503). The peripheral blood smear in megaloblastic anemias contains large macroovalocytes, and the neutrophils often show nuclear hypersegmentation. The major causes of megaloblastic anemia include folate deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and rare inborn errors of metabolism. Other macrocytic anemias with low or normal reticulocyte counts include acquired and congenital (Diamond-­Blackfan anemia and Fanconi anemia) aplastic anemias and hypothyroidism. Patients with trisomy 21 have macrocytic cells, although an accompanying anemia is generally not present. High MCV and reticulocytosis is seen in congenital dyserythropoietic anemias I and III and in situ- ations where hemolysis results in such a large outpouring of young red cells that the MCV is abnormally high.

Chapter 497  u  Congenital Hypoplastic Anemia (Diamond-­Blackfan Anemia)  2931 Diamond-­Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare, congenital bone marrow failure syndrome that usually becomes symptomatic in early infancy. More than 90% of cases are recognized in the first year of life. The dis- order is characterized by anemia, usually normochromic and macro- cytic; reticulocytopenia; and insufficient or absent red blood cell (RBC) precursors in an otherwise normally cellular bone marrow. Up to 50% of affected individuals have additional, extrahematopoietic anomalies. ETIOLOGY The most common DBA-­associated pathogenic variants are in RPS19 (Fig. 497.1). This gene encodes a component protein of the small 40S ribosomal subunit and pathogenic variants are present in approxi- mately 25–30% of patients with additional ribosomal protein (RP) genes, each encoding a different small (40S) or large (60S) ribosomal subunit protein, implicated as well. All of these pathogenic variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, with 40–45% of cases inherited from a parent and 55–60% with a de novo pathogenic variant. Less frequently, X-­linked inherited cases of DBA involve pathologic genetic variants in GATA1 or TSR2. Patients with GATA1-­related DBA usually have no extra hematopoietic manifestations (Fig. 497.2). TSR2-­ related DBA is associated with mandibulofacial dysostosis. Approxi- mately 20% of cases do not have an identified genetic variant. Because most causative variants are in ribosomal genes, the disorder is often referred to as a ribosomopathy. EPIDEMIOLOGY DBA affects about 5-­10 individuals per million live births. Notably, there is substantial phenotypic diversity in DBA, even in families whose mem- bers share the same pathologic genetic variant, suggesting that additional genetic modifiers affect phenotypic expression of the disease. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Profound anemia usually becomes evident by 2-­6 months of age, occa- sionally somewhat later. Approximately 25% of patients are anemic at birth, although hydrops fetalis occurs rarely; 92% are diagnosed within the first year of life. Approximately 40–50% of patients have congenital anomalies, and more than one anomaly is found in 25% of DBA patients (Table 497.1). Craniofacial abnormalities are the most common (50% of patients) and include a depressed nasal bridge and high-­arched palate. Skeletal anomalies, mostly upper limb and hand, affect 30–40%. This includes thumb abnormalities, including flattening of the thenar emi- nence and triphalangeal thumb, that may be bilateral or ­unilateral. The radial pulse may be absent. Genitourinary (39%), cardiac (30%), oph- thalmologic, and musculoskeletal anomalies have also been described. Short stature is common, but it is often unclear whether this characteris- tic results from the disease itself, related therapies, or both. LABORATORY FINDINGS The RBCs are usually macrocytic for age, but no hypersegmented neutrophils or other characteristics of megaloblastic anemia are appreciated on the peripheral blood smear. RBC characteristics are like those of a “fetal” RBC population, with increased expression of “i” antigen and elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity is increased in most patients with DBA, a finding that helps distinguish congenital RBC aplasia from acquired transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) (see Chapter 499). Because elevated eADA activity is not a fetal RBC feature, measurement of this enzyme may be particularly help- ful when diagnosing DBA in very young infants.

Bone marrow erythrocyte precursors are greatly reduced in most patients; other marrow elements are usually normal. Serum iron levels are elevated. Unlike Fanconi anemia, there is no increase in chromosomal breaks when lymphocytes are exposed to alkylat- ing agents. Table 497.2 outlines suggested diagnostic criteria for “classical” DBA. Patients may be diagnosed with “nonclassical” DBA or “probable” DBA depending on their individual genetic test results, family history, and major and minor criteria. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS DBA must be differentiated from other anemias associated with retic- ulocytopenia. The syndrome of TEC is often the primary alternative diagnosis. Table 499.1 shows a useful comparison of findings in these two disorders (see Chapter 499). TEC often is differentiated from DBA by its relatively late onset, although it occasionally develops in infants younger than 6 months of age. Macrocytosis, congenital anomalies, fetal RBC characteristics, and elevated eADA are generally associated with DBA and not TEC. Other inherited macrocytic bone marrow failure syndromes, par- ticularly Fanconi anemia and Shwachman-­Diamond syndrome (see Chapter 517), should also be considered, as should myelodys- plastic syndrome. Aase syndrome includes congenital RBC aplasia with triphalangeal thumb, congenital heart disease, and cleft pal- ate. Hemolytic disease of the newborn can also mimic features of DBA because it can have a protracted course and can be coupled with greatly reduced erythropoiesis. The anemia in this disorder usually resolves spontaneously at 5-­8 weeks of age. Several types of chronic hemolytic diseases may be complicated by an aplastic crisis, characterized by reticulocytopenia and decreased numbers of RBC precursors. This event usually occurs after the first several months of life and is often caused by parvovirus B19 infection (see Chapter 499). Infection with parvovirus B19 in utero is also associ- ated with pure RBC aplasia in infancy and even with hydrops fetalis at birth (see Chapter 298). When diagnosing DBA in young infants, it is important to rule out parvovirus B19 infection using a poly- merase chain reaction assay because serologic testing may be inac- curate. Other infections, including HIV, as well as drugs, immune processes, and Pearson syndrome (see Chapter 498), should also be ruled out. TREATMENT Corticosteroids are a mainstay of therapy, and approximately 80% of patients initially respond. Because corticosteroids impair linear growth as well as physical and neurocognitive development, many hematologists maintain infants on chronic transfusion therapy and delay the start of steroids until after age 1 year. Prednisone or pred- nisolone in doses totaling 2 mg/kg/day is used as an initial trial. An increase in RBC precursors is usually seen in the bone marrow 1-­3 weeks after therapy is begun and is followed by peripheral reticu- locytosis. The hemoglobin can reach normal levels in 4-­6 weeks, although the rate of response is quite variable. Once it is established that the hemoglobin concentration is increasing, the dose of corti- costeroid may be reduced gradually by tapering and then by elimi- nating all except a single, lowest effective daily dose. This dose may Table 497.1     Range of Congenital Anomalies Observed in Diamond-­Blackfan Anemia TYPE/LOCATION ANOMALIES Craniofacial Hypertelorism Broad, flat nasal bridge Cleft palate High-­arched palate Microcephaly Micrognathia Microtia Low-­set ears Low hairline Ptosis Ophthalmologic Congenital glaucoma Strabismus Epicanthal folds Congenital cataract Neck Short neck Webbed neck Sprengel deformity Klippel-­Feil deformity Thumbs Triphalangeal Duplex or bifid Hypoplastic Flat thenar eminence Absent radial artery Urogenital Absent kidney Horseshoe kidney Hypospadias Cardiac Ventricular septal defect Atrial septal defect Coarctation of the aorta Complex cardiac anomalies Other Low birth weight Short stature Syndactyly Learning difficulties Multiple anomalies, most often including craniofacial, are present in up to 25% of af- fected individuals.

The target main- tenance dose should not exceed 0.5 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg every other day. In some patients, very small amounts of prednisone, as low as 2.5 mg twice a week, may be sufficient to sustain adequate erythropoiesis. Scheduled surveillance examinations and testing for corticosteroid side effects should be pursued in all patients, regard- less of dose. Appropriate Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis should be considered after the first month of high-­dose steroids and con- tinued until the patient is on low-­dose alternate-­day therapy. In the setting of illness, stress steroids should be considered for children on chronic corticosteroids. Many children with DBA stop taking corticosteroids, usually because of unacceptable side effects (i.e., cushingoid features, pathologic fractures, cataracts) or the evolu- tion of corticosteroid refractoriness. Chronic red cell transfusions are required in approximately 35% of patients, including patients who are never steroid respon- sive (30%), are steroid refractory (15%), or cannot be weaned to acceptable low dose (50%). Transfusions are given at intervals of 3-­5 weeks to maintain a hemoglobin level >8 g/dL. Some younger children may require hemoglobin >9 g/dL to sustain normal growth and activities. Appropriate screening and ultimately the initia- tion of chelation therapy are required for transfusion-­related iron overload. L-­leucine (700 mg/m2 orally three times per day) has been eval- uated in a phase I/II trial patients with DBA 2 years of age and older. In 43 evaluable patients, 16% had erythroid response, 36% had increase in weight, and 44% had an increase in linear growth velocity. Spontaneous remission of anemia with independence from ste- roid or red cell transfusion therapy has been reported. The like- lihood of remission is 25% by age 25 years, with most of these patients experiencing remission during the first decade. Mild mac- rocytic anemia and increased erythrocyte ADA levels persist in these circumstances. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be cura- tive. Indications for HSCT include steroid resistance or unaccept- able toxicity and transfusion dependence as well as significant complications of chronic red cell transfusions including iron over- load and alloimmunizations. HLA-­matched sibling HSCT is rec- ommended for transfusion-­dependent children with DBA. One recommendation is for HSCT between ages 3 and 9 years, and some advocate HSCT at a younger age to avoid iron overload and allo- sensitization from chronic red cell transfusions. It is important that sibling donors be carefully screened, including genotype if known, to ensure that the donor does not carry the pathologic genetic vari- ant. Overall, outcomes are improving for matched-­sibling and alter- native donor HSCT. PROGNOSIS DBA has been identified as a cancer predisposition syndrome because of the higher risk of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, colon carcinoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and female genital cancers. Patients are at risk for iron overload-­related endocrine abnormalities (diabetes, hypogonadism), especially if transfused. Patients who have undergone HSCT are at risk of asso- ciated late effects (see Chapters 179, 180, and 181). The overall actuarial survival of all patients with DBA is approximately 75% at age 40 years, with approximately 87% for those maintained on corticosteroids and approximately 57% for transfusion-­dependent patients. Of reported deaths, 67% were treatment related and 22% were DBA related (malignancy and severe aplastic anemia). Treatment outcome and survival data are collected through the Diamond-­Blackfan Anemia Registry (https://www.dbar.org). Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. Pearson syndrome (PS) is a rare multisystem mitochondrial disorder that presents with a hypoplastic anemia that may be initially confused with Diamond-­Blackfan syndrome (anemia) or transient erythroblas- topenia of childhood (see Chapter 499). The marrow failure usually appears in the neonatal period and is characterized by a sideroblastic macrocytic anemia and, occasionally, neutropenia and thrombocy- topenia. There are vacuolated erythroblasts and myeloblasts in the bone marrow (Fig. 498.1). PS is considered a unique variant of con- genital sideroblastic anemia because the marrow also contains ringed sideroblasts. The hemoglobin F level is elevated. There is multiorgan involvement manifested by failure to thrive and symptoms of exocrine pancreas dysfunction, liver and renal tubular defects, malabsorption, and myopathy. Endocrine dysfunction (type 1 diabetes, adrenal insuf- ficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism) has also been reported. Children that survive early childhood typically develop Kearns-­Sayre syndrome, an early-­onset, mitochondrial disorder with lactic acidosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (impaired eye movement and ptosis), pigmentary retinitis, deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and heart block. Pearson syndrome is caused by a large heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion (see Chapter 108) that pre- dominates in the hematopoietic lineage. Subsequently, there is hetero- geneity in different tissues and between patients, accounting for the variable clinical picture. The proportion of deleted mtDNA in the bone marrow correlates with the severity of the hematologic disease, and a reduction in the percentage of deleted mtDNA over time may be asso- ciated with spontaneous improvement of red blood cell hypoprolifera- tion. PS may be misdiagnosed as Diamond-­Blackfan anemia (DBA) based on the overlapping features, including severe anemia starting at a young age. Evaluation for mtDNA deletion differentiates PS from DBA (see Chapter 497). Therapy for the hematologic manifestations of the disease includes red cell transfusions to correct anemia and granulocyte colony-­ stimulating factor in the setting of severe neutropenia. The hemato- logic manifestations may spontaneously resolve within the first few years of life and stem cell transplantation may be considered for per- sistent cytopenias.

The target main- tenance dose should not exceed 0.5 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg every other day. In some patients, very small amounts of prednisone, as low as 2.5 mg twice a week, may be sufficient to sustain adequate erythropoiesis. Scheduled surveillance examinations and testing for corticosteroid side effects should be pursued in all patients, regard- less of dose. Appropriate Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis should be considered after the first month of high-­dose steroids and con- tinued until the patient is on low-­dose alternate-­day therapy. In the setting of illness, stress steroids should be considered for children on chronic corticosteroids. Many children with DBA stop taking corticosteroids, usually because of unacceptable side effects (i.e., cushingoid features, pathologic fractures, cataracts) or the evolu- tion of corticosteroid refractoriness. Chronic red cell transfusions are required in approximately 35% of patients, including patients who are never steroid respon- sive (30%), are steroid refractory (15%), or cannot be weaned to acceptable low dose (50%). Transfusions are given at intervals of 3-­5 weeks to maintain a hemoglobin level >8 g/dL. Some younger children may require hemoglobin >9 g/dL to sustain normal growth and activities. Appropriate screening and ultimately the initia- tion of chelation therapy are required for transfusion-­related iron overload. L-­leucine (700 mg/m2 orally three times per day) has been eval- uated in a phase I/II trial patients with DBA 2 years of age and older. In 43 evaluable patients, 16% had erythroid response, 36% had increase in weight, and 44% had an increase in linear growth velocity. Spontaneous remission of anemia with independence from ste- roid or red cell transfusion therapy has been reported. The like- lihood of remission is 25% by age 25 years, with most of these patients experiencing remission during the first decade. Mild mac- rocytic anemia and increased erythrocyte ADA levels persist in these circumstances. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be cura- tive. Indications for HSCT include steroid resistance or unaccept- able toxicity and transfusion dependence as well as significant complications of chronic red cell transfusions including iron over- load and alloimmunizations. HLA-­matched sibling HSCT is rec- ommended for transfusion-­dependent children with DBA. One recommendation is for HSCT between ages 3 and 9 years, and some advocate HSCT at a younger age to avoid iron overload and allo- sensitization from chronic red cell transfusions. It is important that sibling donors be carefully screened, including genotype if known, to ensure that the donor does not carry the pathologic genetic vari- ant. Overall, outcomes are improving for matched-­sibling and alter- native donor HSCT. PROGNOSIS DBA has been identified as a cancer predisposition syndrome because of the higher risk of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, colon carcinoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and female genital cancers. Patients are at risk for iron overload-­related endocrine abnormalities (diabetes, hypogonadism), especially if transfused. Patients who have undergone HSCT are at risk of asso- ciated late effects (see Chapters 179, 180, and 181). The overall actuarial survival of all patients with DBA is approximately 75% at age 40 years, with approximately 87% for those maintained on corticosteroids and approximately 57% for transfusion-­dependent patients. Of reported deaths, 67% were treatment related and 22% were DBA related (malignancy and severe aplastic anemia). Treatment outcome and survival data are collected through the Diamond-­Blackfan Anemia Registry (https://www.dbar.org). Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. Pearson syndrome (PS) is a rare multisystem mitochondrial disorder that presents with a hypoplastic anemia that may be initially confused with Diamond-­Blackfan syndrome (anemia) or transient erythroblas- topenia of childhood (see Chapter 499). The marrow failure usually appears in the neonatal period and is characterized by a sideroblastic macrocytic anemia and, occasionally, neutropenia and thrombocy- topenia. There are vacuolated erythroblasts and myeloblasts in the bone marrow (Fig. 498.1). PS is considered a unique variant of con- genital sideroblastic anemia because the marrow also contains ringed sideroblasts. The hemoglobin F level is elevated.

It is more prevalent than congenital hypoplastic anemia (Diamond-­Blackfan anemia [DBA]). This syndrome of severe transient hypoplastic ane- mia occurs mainly in previously healthy children between 6 months and 3 years of age. Most children are older than 12 months at onset. Only 10% of affected patients are more than 3 years of age. The annual incidence is estimated to be 4.3 cases per 100,000 children, although it is likely higher, because TEC often resolves spontane- ously with many cases undiagnosed. The suppression of erythro- poiesis has been linked to IgG, IgM, and cell-­mediated mechanisms. Familial cases have been reported, suggesting a hereditary compo- nent. TEC often follows a viral illness, although no specific virus has been consistently implicated. The temporary suppression of erythropoiesis results in reticulo- cytopenia and moderate to severe normocytic anemia. Some degree of neutropenia occurs in up to 20% of cases. Platelet numbers are normal or elevated. Like the situation observed in iron-­deficiency anemia and other red blood cell (RBC) hypoplasias, thrombocyto- sis is presumably caused by increased erythropoietin (EPO), which has homology to thrombopoietin (TPO). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is characteristically normal for age, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels are normal before the recovery phase. RBC adenos- ine deaminase levels are normal in TEC, thus contrasting with the elevation noted in most cases of congenital hypoplastic anemia (Table 499.1). Differentiation from DBA is sometimes difficult, but differences in age at onset and in age-­related MCV, HbF, and ade- nosine deaminase are usually helpful. The peak occurrence of TEC coincides with that of iron-­deficiency anemia in infants receiving milk as their main caloric source; differences in MCV should help to distinguish between TEC and DBA. Virtually all children recover within 1-­2 months. RBC transfu- sions may be necessary for severe anemia in the absence of signs of early recovery. The anemia develops slowly, and significant symp- toms usually develop only with severe anemia. Corticosteroid ther- apy is of no value in this disorder. Any child with presumed TEC who requires more than one transfusion should be reevaluated for another possible diagnosis. In rare instances, a prolonged case of apparent TEC may be caused by parvovirus-­induced RBC apla- sia, occurring in children with hemolytic anemia or congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies. RED CELL APLASIA ASSOCIATED WITH ­PARVOVIRUS B19 INFECTION Parvovirus B19 is a common infectious agent that causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) (see Chapter 298). It is also the most clearly documented viral cause of RBC aplasia in patients with chronic hemolytic anemia or an immunocompromised state. This single-­stranded virus is cytotoxic to marrow erythroid progenitor cells, interacting specifically by binding to the red cell P antigen. In addition to decreased or absent erythroid precursors, characteristic nuclear inclusions in erythroblasts and giant pronormoblasts may be seen under light microscopy in bone marrow specimens. The virus does not cause significant anemia in immunocompetent indi- viduals with a normal RBC life span. Because parvovirus infection usually lasts less than 2 weeks, ane- mia may not develop or be appreciated in otherwise normal chil- dren whose peripheral RBC life span is 100-­120 days. The RBC life span is much shorter in patients with chronic hemolysis secondary to conditions such as hereditary spherocytosis, immune hemolytic anemia, or sickle cell disease. In these children, a brief cessation of erythropoiesis can cause severe anemia, known as aplastic crisis. When a definitive diagnosis is required, the workup should include Chapter 499 Acquired Pure Red Blood Cell Anemia Courtney D.

In young infants, a poly- merase chain reaction (PCR) assay should be used since serologic testing may be inaccurate. Recovery from moderate to severe ane- mia is usually spontaneous, heralded by the appearance of nucle- ated RBCs and subsequent reticulocytosis in the peripheral blood. Nonetheless the parvovirus PCR may remain positive for months after recovery. An RBC transfusion may be necessary if the anemia is associated with significant symptoms. Parvovirus-­induced aplas- tic crisis usually occurs only once in children with chronic hemoly- sis. In families with more than one child with a hemolytic disorder, parents should be warned that a similar aplastic episode can occur in the other children if they have not been previously infected. Dur- ing the episode of aplastic crisis, the child is potentially contagious and should be isolated from at-­risk patients. Persistent parvovirus infection may occur in children with con- genital immunodeficiency diseases, lymphoproliferative disorders, those being treated with immunosuppressive agents, and those with HIV/AIDS, because these children may be unable to mount an ade- quate antibody response. The resultant pure RBC aplasia may be severe, and affected children may be thought to have TEC. This type of RBC aplasia differs from TEC in that there is no spontaneous recovery, and more than one transfusion is often needed. The diag- nosis of parvovirus infection is made by PCR of peripheral blood or bone marrow DNA because the usual serologic responses, reflected by parvovirus serum IgM or IgG titers, are impaired in immuno- deficient children. In chronically infected patients, the disease may be treated with high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin, which contains neutralizing antibody to parvovirus and is effective in the short term. Parvovirus infection and destruction of erythroid precursors can also occur in utero. Such events are associated with increased rates of fetal loss in the first and second trimesters. Infants may be born with hydrops fetalis and anemia (see Chapter 138). The presence of persistent congenital parvovirus infection is detected by PCR of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow DNA because immunologic tolerance to the virus can prevent the usual development of specific antibodies. OTHER RED CELL APLASIAS IN CHILDREN Acquired red cell aplasia in adults is usually mediated by a chronic antibody and often associated with disorders such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, thymoma, lymphoprolifera- tive disorders, and systemic lupus erythematosus. This chronic antibody-­mediated type of RBC aplasia, often responsive to immu- nosuppressive therapy, is quite rare in childhood. Cases of acquired pure RBC aplasia attributable to T-­cell suppression have also been described. Infections other than parvovirus, such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-­Barr virus, and human herpes virus-­6, may cause pure RBC aplasia. Certain drugs, such as chloramphenicol, also can inhibit erythropoiesis in a dose-­dependent manner. Reticulocytopenia, erythroid hypoplasia, and vacuolated pronormoblasts in the bone marrow are reversible effects of this drug. These effects are distinct from the idiosyncratic and rare development of severe aplastic ane- mia in chloramphenicol recipients. Acquired antibody-­mediated (to erythropoietin) pure RBC aplasia is a rare complication in chronic kidney disease patients treated with erythropoietin. In addition to discontinuing erythropoiesis-­stimulating agents, therapy and addressing anemia with red cell transfusions, further treatment may require immunosuppression and eventually renal transplantation.

Thornburg The anemia of chronic disease (ACD), also referred to as anemia of inflammation, is found in conditions where there is ongoing immune activation. It occurs in a wide range of disorders, including infections, malignancies, chronic disease, autoimmunity, and graft-­versus-­host disease. A similar anemia is associated with chronic kidney disease. ACD is typically a mild to moderate normocytic, normochromic, hypoproliferative anemia associated with a decreased serum iron and low transferrin saturation. ETIOLOGY Decreased red cell life span, impaired erythropoiesis, and an increased uptake of iron in the reticuloendothelial system are important mecha- nisms contributing to ACD. ACD-­associated alterations in iron recycling are characterized by an accumulation of iron in reticuloendothelial macrophages despite low levels of serum iron. The diversion of iron from the circulation into the reticuloendothelial system results in func- tional iron deficiency, which causes the impaired heme synthe- sis and iron-­restricted erythropoiesis that contribute to anemia. These alterations in iron metabolism have been attributed to inflammation-­associated excess synthesis of hepcidin, a key regula- tory protein that controls intestinal iron absorption and tissue dis- tribution. Hepcidin, although mainly synthesized by hepatocytes, is expressed in other cells, including monocytes and macrophages. It functions by binding to and initiating the degradation of the iron exporter, ferroportin (Fig. 500.1). CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Although the important symptoms and signs associated with ACD are those of the underlying disease, the mild to moderate anemia can affect the patient’s quality of life. LABORATORY FINDINGS Hemoglobin concentrations are generally 6-­9 g/dL. The anemia is usually normochromic and normocytic, although some patients have modest hypochromia and microcytosis, particularly if there is con- comitant iron deficiency. Absolute reticulocyte counts are normal or low, and leukocytosis is common. The serum iron level is low, with- out the increase in serum transferrin (the iron transport protein) that occurs in iron deficiency. This pattern of low serum iron and low-­to-­ normal serum transferrin is a valuable diagnostic feature. However, note that the serum ferritin level may be elevated secondary to inflam- mation. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a useful diagnostic test to distinguish ACD from iron-­deficiency anemia (IDA) because sTfR levels are high in IDA and normal in ACD. A bone marrow biopsy typi- cally shows normal cellularity with decreased or adequate red blood cell precursors; marrow hemosiderin may be increased and granulo- cytic hyperplasia may be present.

Hepcidin, produced by hepatocytes, downregulates iron export to circulating transferrin from iron “donor” cells (hepatocytes, macrophages, and duodenal enterocytes) by promoting the internalization and lysosomal degra- dation of ferroportin. Hepatocytes take up iron in several forms, whereas enterocytes obtain their iron predomi- nantly from the gut lumen, and macrophages are spe- cialized to deal with the high throughput of iron from senescent red cells.

If the associated systemic disease can be controlled, the anemia typically improves or resolves. Transfusions raise the hemoglo- bin concentration temporarily but are rarely indicated. Erythropoiesis-­ stimulating agents (ESAs), such as recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) or related extended half-­life formulations, increase the hemo- globin level and improve activity and the sense of well-­being. When using ESAs, treatment with iron is usually necessary to produce optimal effect. Response to these agents is highly variable, and poorly respon- sive patients may require high doses to reach target hemoglobin levels. In adults, high doses are associated with a higher incidence of adverse events, such as stroke, cardiovascular events, cancer progression, and death, leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require a “black box” warning on labels. ACD does not respond to iron alone unless there is concomitant deficiency. Unfortunately, it is a common clinical challenge to identify iron deficiency in patients with an inflammatory disease (see Chapters 496 and 504). In this circumstance, a trial of iron therapy might be helpful, although there may be no response because persistent inflam- mation impairs iron absorption and utilization; intravenous iron may further increase hepcidin production.

The anemia is usually normocytic, and the absolute reticulocyte count is normal or low. Although most patients with end-­stage renal disease (ESRD) are anemic, earlier stages of CKD are also associated with a lower prevalence of anemia. In adults, a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been correlated with lower hemoglobin concentration, and hemoglobin has been reported to decline below a GFR threshold of 40-­ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In children with CKD, hemoglobin levels decline as the GFR decreases below 43 mL/min/1.73 m2. Decreased hemoglobin values are linked to increased incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired physical activity, and a reduced quality of life in pediatric patients with CKD. In those with ESRD on dialysis, anemia is also associated with increased risk of hospitalization and mortality. ETIOLOGY Although the anemia of CKD shares many features with anemia of chronic disease, its predominant cause is decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production by diseased kidneys. Other important causes include absolute and/or functional iron deficiency because of chronic blood loss (from blood sampling, surgeries, and dialysis) and disturbances in iron metabolism. Higher hepcidin levels have also been implicated in the anemia of CKD. Hepcidin is filtered by the glomerulus and excreted by the kidney; serum concentrations are increased in patients with decreased GFR. Inflammation may also be a contributing factor in pediatric dialysis patients who have elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Hyperparathyroidism and deficiencies of vitamin B12, folate, and carnitine may also have a role in anemia of CKD. LABORATORY FINDINGS Anemia in children with CKD is defined by age: hemoglobin <11.0 g/dL (0.5-­5 years), <11.5 g/dL (5-­12 years), <12 g/dL (12-­15 years), <13.0 g/dL (males >15 years), and <12.0 g/dL (females >15 years). The anemia of CKD is hypoproliferative and usually normocytic and normochromic, unless there is concomitant iron deficiency or vitamin deficiency.

Current IV iron preparations (iron-­gluconate, iron-­ sucrose, iron-­carboxymaltose, iron-­isomaltoside, ferumoxytol) have iron as a core within a carbohydrate stabilizer shell, thus preventing the uncontrolled release of free iron and thus reducing serious side effects. Erythropoiesis-­stimulating agents (ESAs) are the mainstay of ther- apy and, particularly for children with ESRD, have greatly reduced the need for frequent transfusions, decreasing the incidence of associated iron overload and alloimmunization. Hemoglobin levels at which ESAs are initiated may be guided by individual patient characteristics, with a goal of 11-­12 g/dL for chil- dren on maintenance ESA therapy. Dosing varies with age and dialysis modality. Darbepoetin, a synthetic form of EPO, appears to be equally effective as recombinant human EPO and has the benefit of less fre- quent dosing because of a longer half-­life. Iron therapy should be pre- scribed when using ESAs because treatment demands additional iron for erythropoiesis. Infants and children require higher doses of ESAs. In the rare case in which anti-­EPO antibody-­mediated pure red cell aplasia develops, ESA therapy should be stopped, and immunomodu- latory therapy may be indicated to suppress the antibody response.

The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are a heterogeneous class of inherited disorders resulting from abnormalities of late eryth- ropoiesis. These rare conditions are characterized by variable degrees of anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, hyperbilirubinemia, gallstones, splenomegaly, and secondary hemochromatosis (iron overload). They may be misdiagnosed as other congenital anemias, such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia. Dyserythropoiesis is the major cause of anemia but a shortened half-­life of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) may also contribute. The CDAs have been classified into four major types (I, II, III, and IV) and variants based on distinctive bone mar- row morphology, clinical features, and genetic mutations. Genetic test- ing is now the key method for achieving a timely accurate diagnosis (Fig. 501.1). CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA TYPE I Pathogenesis Type I CDA (CDA I) is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused by pathogenic variants in CDAN1, the first gene to be implicated, which encodes Codanin-­1, a cell-­cycle regulated protein. Pathogenic vari- ants in CDIN1 (CDAN1-­interacting nuclease 1, previously C15orf41) Chapter 501 Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemias Courtney D. Thornburg also cause CDA I. Proteins encoded by CDAN1 and CDIN1 likely contribute to DNA repair and/or chromatin reassembly after DNA replication. Clinical Manifestations CDA I may be diagnosed at any age, although most cases are recog- nized during childhood or adolescence in the setting of moderate to severe macrocytic anemia with relative reticulocytopenia. CDA I is rarely diagnosed in utero with severe anemia resulting in hydrops feta- lis. Neonates with CDA 1 may have neonatal jaundice or pulmonary hypertension related to anemia. Type I CDA has been associated with dysmorphic features in 4–25% of patients, primarily involving the digits (syndactyly, absence of nails or curved toenails, supernumerary toes, skin pigmentation, café-­au-­lait spots, macrocephaly, dolichoceph- aly, spinal fusion, scoliosis, and short stature). Patients have progressive iron overload even in the absence of transfusions. Laboratory Findings Hemoglobin concentrations generally range between 7-­11 g/dL. The anemia is usually macrocytic (mean corpuscular volume: 100-­120 fL), but normocytic indices may be seen during childhood. Aniso- poikilocytosis is appreciated on the peripheral blood smear. In some cases, normoblasts and basophilic stippling of RBCs may be seen. The reticulocyte count is inadequate for the degree of anemia (reticulo- cytopenia). Elevated serum ferritin secondary to iron overload may be present. The bone marrow aspirate shows erythroid hyperpla- sia. Binucleate erythroblasts make up 2.5–10% of late erythroblasts. Incompletely divided cells with thin chromatin bridges between nuclei of pairs of erythrocytes are highly specific for type I CDA. Electron microscopy is the gold standard for clinical diagnosis, revealing eryth- roblasts with a characteristic “Swiss cheese” heterochromatin pattern. Treatment Treatment of this disorder includes transfusions, especially in the neo- natal period and early childhood and in association with co-­inherited disorders, such as thalassemia or RBC enzymopathy. However, ado- lescents and adults may require episodic transfusions only during aplastic crises, infection, or pregnancy. For patients with CDAN1 mutations, treatment with PEGylated interferon-­α2 can reduce trans- fusion requirements. Because of potential side effects of spastic diple- gia and peripheral neuropathy, treatment initiation may be reserved for patients beyond early childhood requiring frequent transfusions. Patients do not respond to erythropoietin; splenectomy is generally not recommended. Cholecystectomy is often required for management of pigmented gallstones. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may also be considered for severe cases. The most important long-­term complication is progressive iron overload, caused by increased intestinal absorption of iron and inef- fective erythropoiesis and transfusion therapy. Regular phlebotomies is a treatment option as long as there is not significant anemia. If this approach is untenable, chelation therapy should be employed when repeated ferritin levels exceed 1,000 μg/L or liver iron is elevated as determined by hepatic magnetic resonance imaging T2*. CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA TYPE II Pathogenesis CDA type II (CDA II), the most common type of CDA, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in SEC23B.

Clinical Manifestations CDA II presents with varying degrees of normocytic anemia and no or mild reticulocytosis. Approximately 20% of patients are transfusion dependent.

A, Light microscopy analysis of the bone marrow from patients with different CDA subtypes. CDA patients generally show erythroid hyperplasia. Red arrows indicate typical findings for each CDA subtype: CDAI, internuclear chromatin bridging; CDAII, binucleate erythroid precursors; CDAIII, giant multinucleated erythroblasts; CDAIV, multinucleate erythroblasts; and CAD deficiency, binucleate CDAII-­like precursors. B, Pie chart showing the frequencies of the different CDA subtypes diagnosed after genetic testing in patients clinically suspected of having CDA. The frequency of each condition was calculated as the ratio between the number of patients in each CDA subtype and the overall count of patients tested (n = 218 patients [those included in our international registry of CDAs from 1995 to 2019]). Six patients originally suspected of CDA showed conclusive diagnosis of acquired dyserythropoiesis: two patients with liver failure, two with iron-­deficiency anemia, one with erythrophagocytosis, and one with transient erythroblastopenia. Syndromic CDA refers to one patient with a mutation in the CAD gene. GATA1-­related cytopenias include: X-­linked thrombocytopenia with or without dys- erythropoietic anemia; congenital erythropoietic porphyria; and idiopathic cytopenias of undetermined significance. Other hereditary anemias (HA) include: hereditary spherocytosis; hereditary dehydrated stomatocytosis; red cell enzymatic defects; and sideroblastic anemia. The undiagnosed cases were evaluated by analysis of the CDA gene panel, by extended targeted next-­generation sequencing for hereditary anemias, or by whole-­ exome sequencing. C, Bubble chart defining the lengths of the coding sequences of each CDA-­causative gene and their relative pathogenicity scores. These scores were calculated by combining the constraint metrics of each gene available at the ExAC database (http://exac.broadinstitute.o rg/). High pathogenicity scores identify increased constraints (intolerance to variation). The more intolerant to variation a gene is, the less likely it is to be mutated. The size of each bubble represents the frequency of the mutations in each gene, as calculated by the ratio of the number of mutated alleles for each gene and the overall count of disease alleles (n = 149, from 78 patients included in our international registry of CDAs from 2008 to 2019).

Iron overload occurs in both transfusion dependent and independent patients. Laboratory Findings The anemia is normocytic and is generally mild with inappropriately low reticulocytes. Hemoglobin levels are lower in children than adults and range from 8-­11 g/dL. The peripheral blood smear shows anisopoikilocy- tosis, occasional basophilic stippling, as well as a few, sometimes binucle- ate, mature erythroblasts. The bone marrow aspirate is normoblastic but hypercellular, with erythroid hyperplasia. Binucleated and multinucleated erythroblasts with equal nuclei size (10–35%) and karyorrhexis (frag- mentation of the nuclei) in >2% are ­characteristic. Electron micrographs demonstrate vesicles laden with endoplasmic reticulum proteins run- ning beneath the plasma membrane (double membranes). Ninety-­five percent of patients with CDA II have hypoglycosylated band 3, which has faster migration on the gel, and the diagnosis may be made by ana- lyzing red blood cell membrane proteins with sodium dodecyl sulfate-­ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE). Treatment Most patients can lead a normal life and have a normal life expec- tancy if complications and consequences are managed appropriately. Approximately 10% of patients will require red cell transfusions in infancy and childhood but rarely during adulthood. Splenectomy may provide hematologic improvement and is currently recommended for patients with severe anemia and/or symptomatic splenomegaly. Splenectomy does not prevent further iron overloading, even in those patients whose hemoglobin is normalized, presumably because of per- sistent ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. Secondary iron overload is the most prominent long-­term complication and should be approached as previously outlined. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may also be considered for severe cases. CONGENITAL DYSERYTHROPOIETIC ANEMIA TYPE III CDA type III (CDA III) is an extremely rare, poorly defined entity characterized by mild to moderate macrocytic anemia. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant or de novo fashion, although there have been cases that might represent other inheritance patterns. CDA III is caused by pathogenic variants in KIF23, which encodes a ubiquitous protein, mitotic kinesin-­like protein 1, which regulates daughter cell separation during mitosis. Iron overload is not clinically significant (likely due to hemolysis being predominantly intravascular), and spleen size is gen- erally normal. Patients can present with angioid streaks with macular degeneration. An association with monoclonal gammopathy and mul- tiple myeloma is also reported. The blood smear shows macrocytes, anisopoikilocytosis, and occasional basophilic stippling. The bone marrow is notable for giant erythroid precursors that are often mul- tinucleated, containing up to 12 nuclei per cell. Such multinucleated erythroblasts can also be seen in myelodysplasia and erythroleukemia. Transfusions are usually not required.

Chapter 502  u  Physiologic Anemia of Infancy  2939 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR–RELATED CDA Transcription factor–related CDA includes CDA type IV (CDA IV) and X-­linked thrombocytopenia with or without dyserythropoietic anemia (XLTDA). CDA IV has an autosomal dominant inheritance due to patho- genic variants in KLF1, which encodes an erythroid transcription factor that regulates fetal hemoglobin switching and is necessary for terminal erythroid differentiation. Patients have severe hemolytic anemia with no or mild reticulocytosis and very high fetal hemoglobin. Bone marrow morphology consists of hypercellularity and binucleate or multinucleate erythroblasts. Electron micrographs show immature red cell progenitors that have atypical inclusions within the cytoplasm, nuclear membrane invaginations, and heterochromatin. XLTDA is an X-­linked condition due to pathogenic variants in GATA1, a DNA-­binding protein with two zinc fingers and a transacti- vation domain that plays a key role in development and maintenance of red cell and platelet lineages. The laboratory features of this condi- tion include mild to severe anemia and macrothrombocytopenia with poorly granulated platelets. Bone marrow morphology shows dys- erythropoiesis and megakaryocytes that are abnormal and reduced in number. Patients present with bleeding and anemia, and management includes transfusion and supportive care. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. At birth, normal full-­term infants have higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels and larger red blood cells (RBCs) than do older children and adults. However, within the first week of life, a progressive decline in Hb level begins and then persists for 6-­8 weeks. The resulting anemia is known as the physiologic anemia of infancy. With the onset of respiration at birth, considerably more oxygen becomes available for binding to Hb, and as a result the Hb-­oxygen saturation increases from 50–95% or more. There is also a gradual, nor- mal developmental switch from fetal to adult Hb synthesis after birth that results in the replacement of high-­oxygen-­affinity fetal Hb with lower-­affinity adult Hb, capable of delivering more oxygen to tissues. The increase in blood oxygen content and delivery results in the down- regulation of erythropoietin (EPO) production, leading to suppres- sion of erythropoiesis. Because there is no erythropoiesis, aged RBCs that are removed from the circulation are not replaced, and the Hb level decreases. The Hb concentration continues to decline until tis- sue oxygen needs become greater than oxygen delivery. Normally, this point is reached between 8-­12 weeks of age, when the Hb concentration is about 11 g/dL. In healthy term infants, the nadir rarely falls below 10 g/dL. At this juncture, EPO production increases and erythropoiesis resumes. The supply of stored reticuloendothelial iron, derived from pre- viously degraded RBCs, remains sufficient for this renewed Hb synthesis, even in the absence of dietary iron intake, until approximately 20 weeks of age. In all, this “anemia” should be viewed as a physiologic adaptation to extrauterine life, reflecting the excess oxygen delivery relative to tissue oxygen requirements. There is no hematologic problem, and no therapy is required unless physiologic anemia of infancy is exacerbated by other ongoing processes including nutritional deficiency and blood loss. The degree of anemia at birth is correlated with maternal hemoglobin. A late hyporegenerative anemia, with reticulocytopenia, can occur in infants with hemolytic disease of the newborn. The persistence of mater- nally derived anti-­RBC antibodies in the infant’s circulation can lead to an Chapter 502 Physiologic Anemia of Infancy Courtney D. Thornburg ongoing low-­grade hemolytic anemia that can exaggerate the physiologic anemia. Lower-­than-­expected Hb at the “physiologic” nadir has also been seen in infants after intrauterine or neonatal RBC transfusions. When infants are transfused with adult blood containing HbA, the associated shift of the oxygen dissociation curve facilitates oxygen delivery to the tissues. Accordingly, the definition of anemia and the need for transfusion should be based not only on the infant’s Hb level, but also on oxygen requirements and the ability of circulating RBCs to release oxygen to the tissues. Premature infants also develop a physiologic anemia, known as ­anemia of prematurity. The Hb decline is both more extreme and more rapid. Hb levels of 7-­9 g/dL usually are reached by 3-­6 weeks of age, and levels may be even lower in very small premature infants (see Chapter 139). The same physiologic factors at play in term infants are exaggerated in preterm infants. In premature infants, the physiologic Hb decline may be intensified by blood loss from repeated phlebotomies obtained to monitor ill neonates. Demands on erythropoiesis are further heightened by the premature infant’s presumed shortened RBC life span (40-­60 days) and the accelerated expansion of RBC mass that accompanies the premature baby’s rapid rate of growth. Nonetheless, plasma EPO levels are lower than would be expected for the degree of anemia, resulting in a suboptimal erythropoietic response. The reason for diminished EPO levels is not fully understood. During fetal life, EPO synthesis is handled primar- ily by the liver, and the liver’s oxygen sensor is less sensitive to hypoxia compared with that of the kidney. The developmental switch from liver to kidney EPO production is not accelerated by early birth, and thus the preterm infant must rely on the liver as the primary site for synthesis, lead- ing to diminished responsiveness to anemia. An additional mechanism thought to contribute to diminished EPO levels may be accelerated EPO metabolism. Because the pronounced decline in Hb that occurs in many very low birthweight infants may be associated with abnormal clinical signs, this “anemia of prematurity” is not considered benign and usually requires transfusions when symptomatic. TREATMENT In the full-­term infant, physiologic anemia requires no therapy beyond ensuring that the infant’s diet contains essential nutrients for normal hematopoiesis. For infants who are exclusively breastfed,  iron supple- mentation is indicated beginning at 4 months of age and continued until oral iron intake via food is sufficient. In premature infants, an optimal Hb has not been established and is usually dictated by the infant’s overall clinical condition. Transfusions may be needed to maintain the Hb at what is considered safe for that child. Premature infants who are feeding well and growing normally rarely need transfusion unless iatrogenic blood loss has been significant. Although factors such as poor weight gain, respira- tory difficulties, and abnormal heart rate have prompted transfusion, the beneficial effect has not been documented. Laboratory tests such as blood lactate, EPO, and mixed venous oxygen saturation have poor predictive value. A restrictive strategy does not increase infant morbidity or mor- tality. Long-­term neurodevelopmental outcomes have been found to be poorer in liberally transfused neonates. Exposure to packed RBCs may be related to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis, and early transfu- sions may be associated with the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. Iron supplementation is indicated starting at 2 to 6 weeks of age until 6 to 12 months of age; dosing depends on birth weight and infants with smaller birth weights require higher doses. Strategies to decrease anemia include delayed cord clamping, avoiding unnecessary phlebotomy, and providing adequate iron supplementation. Delayed cord clamping at birth results in fewer transfusions and a reduc- tion in both intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Given the impact of phlebotomy losses during monitor- ing in the neonatal intensive care unit, attention to reducing unnecessary blood draws also has been advocated. Iron therapy is indicated for all neo- nates with anemia of prematurity starting at 1 month of age and continu- ing until about 1 year of age. Iron is prescribed as mg of elemental iron per kg/day and depends on birthweight. When transfusions are necessary, an RBC volume of 10-­15 mL/kg is recommended. It is good practice to split units derived from a single donor to minimize donor exposure if sequential transfusions are indicated.

Transfusions may be needed to maintain the Hb at what is considered safe for that child. Premature infants who are feeding well and growing normally rarely need transfusion unless iatrogenic blood loss has been significant. Although factors such as poor weight gain, respira- tory difficulties, and abnormal heart rate have prompted transfusion, the beneficial effect has not been documented. Laboratory tests such as blood lactate, EPO, and mixed venous oxygen saturation have poor predictive value. A restrictive strategy does not increase infant morbidity or mor- tality. Long-­term neurodevelopmental outcomes have been found to be poorer in liberally transfused neonates. Exposure to packed RBCs may be related to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis, and early transfu- sions may be associated with the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. Iron supplementation is indicated starting at 2 to 6 weeks of age until 6 to 12 months of age; dosing depends on birth weight and infants with smaller birth weights require higher doses. Strategies to decrease anemia include delayed cord clamping, avoiding unnecessary phlebotomy, and providing adequate iron supplementation. Delayed cord clamping at birth results in fewer transfusions and a reduc- tion in both intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Given the impact of phlebotomy losses during monitor- ing in the neonatal intensive care unit, attention to reducing unnecessary blood draws also has been advocated. Iron therapy is indicated for all neo- nates with anemia of prematurity starting at 1 month of age and continu- ing until about 1 year of age. Iron is prescribed as mg of elemental iron per kg/day and depends on birthweight. When transfusions are necessary, an RBC volume of 10-­15 mL/kg is recommended. It is good practice to split units derived from a single donor to minimize donor exposure if sequential transfusions are indicated.

Red blood cells (RBCs) are larger than normal at every developmental stage, and there is maturational asyn- chrony between the nucleus and cytoplasm of erythrocytes. The delayed nuclear development becomes increasingly evident as cell divi- sions proceed. Myeloid and platelet precursors are also affected, and giant metamyelocytes and neutrophil bands are often present in the bone marrow. There is often an associated thrombocytopenia and leuko- penia. The peripheral blood smear is notable for large, often oval RBCs with increased mean corpuscular volume (Fig. 503.1). Neutrophils are characteristically hypersegmented, with many having more than five lobes (see Fig. 503.1). Most cases of childhood megaloblastic anemia result from a deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B12 (cobalamin), vita- mins essential for DNA synthesis (Table 503.1). Rarely, these anemias may be caused by inborn errors of metabolism. Megaloblastic anemias resulting from malnutrition are relatively uncommon in the United States but are important worldwide (see Chapters 62, 64, and 496). 503.1  Folic Acid Deficiency Courtney D. Thornburg Folates are essential for DNA replication and cellular proliferation. Humans cannot synthesize folate and must depend on dietary sources, including green vegetables, fruits, and animal organs (e.g., liver, kid- ney). Folates are heat labile and water soluble; consequently, boiling or heating folate sources leads to decreased amounts of the vitamin. Naturally occurring folates are in a polyglutamated form that is less efficiently absorbed than the monoglutamate species (i.e., folic acid). Dietary folate polyglutamates are hydrolyzed to simple folates that are absorbed primarily in the proximal small intestine by a specific carrier-­mediated system. Folates travel in the bloodstream and are taken up in cells, primarily in the form of unconjugated methyltetra- hydrofolate, which is subsequently reconjugated (polyglutamated) in the cell. There is an active enterohepatic circulation. Although rare, megaloblastic anemia because of folate deficiency has its peak inci- dence at 4-­7 months of age, somewhat earlier than iron-­deficiency ane- mia, although both conditions may be present concomitantly in infants with poor nutrition. ETIOLOGY Folic acid deficiency can result from inadequate folate intake, decreased folate absorption, or acquired and congenital disorders of folate metab- olism or transport (Table 503.2). Inadequate Folate Intake In the United States, anemia caused by insufficient folate intake usu- ally occurs in the context of increased vitamin requirements associated with pregnancy, periods of accelerated growth, and chronic hemo- lysis (see Chapter 67.6). Folate requirements greatly increase during pregnancy, in part to meet fetal needs, and deficiencies are common in mothers, particularly those who are poor or malnourished. Folate supplementation is recommended from the start of pregnancy to pre- vent neural tube defects and to meet the needs of the developing fetus. Folate-­deficient mothers generally do not give birth to infants with clinical folate deficiency because there is selective transfer of folate Chapter 503 Megaloblastic Anemias Courtney D.

Rapid growth after birth increases demands for folic acid, and infants who are premature or ill and those with certain hemolytic disorders will have particularly high folate requirements. Human breast milk, infant formulas, and pasteur- ized cow’s milk provide adequate amounts of folic acid. Goat’s milk is folate deficient, and supplementation must be given when it is the child’s main food source. Unless supplemented, powdered milk may also be a poor source of folic acid. Malnutrition is the most common cause of folate deficiency in older children. In addition, children with chronic hemolytic anemias, infec- tions, or malabsorption are at increased risk due to increased demand. Because body stores of folate are limited, deficiency can develop quickly in malnourished individuals. On a folate-­free diet, megaloblastic ane- mia will occur after 2-­3 months. Decreased Folate Absorption Malabsorption caused by chronic diarrheal states or diffuse inflam- matory disease can lead to folate deficiency. In both situations, some of the decreased folate absorption may be caused by impaired folate con- jugase activity. Chronic diarrhea also interferes with the enterohepatic circulation of folate, thereby enhancing folate losses because of rapid intestinal passage. Megaloblastic anemia caused by folic acid deficiency can occur in celiac disease or chronic infectious enteritis and in associ- ation with enteroenteric fistulas. Previous intestinal surgery is another potential cause of decreased folate absorption. Certain anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital) can impair folic acid absorption, and many patients treated with these drugs have low serum levels. Frank megaloblastic anemia is rare and readily responds to folic acid therapy, even when administration of the offending drug is continued. Alcohol overuse also is associated with folate malabsorption. Congenital Abnormalities in Folate Transport and Metabolism Inborn errors of folate transport or metabolism are rare but can be life threatening. Those associated with megaloblastic anemia include hereditary folate malabsorption and certain extremely uncommon enzyme deficiencies. Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) is an autosomal reces- sive disorder caused by loss-­of-­function pathogenic variants in the SLC46A1 gene encoding the protein-­coupled folate transporter. HFM is associated with an inability to absorb folic acid, 5-­tetrahydrofolate, 5-­methyltetrahydrofolate, or 5-­formyltetrahydrofolate (folinic acid). It can become apparent at 2-­6 months of age with megaloblastic ane- mia and other deficits, including infections and diarrhea. Neurologic abnormalities attributable to folate deficiency in the central nervous system (CNS) include seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Folate transport is impaired both in the intestine and at the brain’s choroid plexus. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) folate levels are very low, with a loss of the normal 3:1 ratio of CSF to serum folate. Treatment for HFM involves parenteral (intramuscular) folate or high-­dose oral 5-­formyltetrahydrofolate (5-­formylTHF), folinic acid, leucovorin, or the active isomer of 5-­formylTHF (Isovorin or Fusilev) targeting normal or near normal trough levels in the CSF to ameliorate both the megaloblastic anemia and neurologic complications of folate deficiency. Functional methionine synthase deficiency may result from patho- logic genetic variants affecting the function of methionine synthase reductase or methionine synthase. These disorders are autosomal reces- sive and characterized not only by megaloblastic anemia but also by cerebral atrophy, nystagmus, blindness, and altered muscle tone. Both respond to hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl) plus betaine with variable clini- cal success. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) deficiency is extremely rare and is associated with homozygous pathologic genetic variants in the DHFR gene. Clinical symptoms include megaloblastic anemia and neurologic manifestations. Although methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency is the most common inborn error of folate metabolism, and severe cases can produce several neurologic and vascular complications, there is no associated megaloblastic anemia.

All rights reserved. 2942  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood Drug-­Induced Abnormalities in Folate Metabolism Several drugs have anti–folic acid activity as their primary pharmaco- logic effect and regularly produce megaloblastic anemia. Methotrexate binds to dihydrofolate reductase and prevents formation of tetrahydro- folate, the active form of folate. Pyrimethamine, used in the therapy of toxoplasmosis, and trimethoprim, used for treatment of various infec- tions, can induce folic acid deficiency and occasionally megaloblastic anemia. Therapy with folinic acid (5-­formyltetrahydrofolate) is usually beneficial. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS In addition to the clinical features associated with anemia, folate-­ deficient infants and children may manifest irritability, chronic diar- rhea, and poor weight gain. Hemorrhages from thrombocytopenia may occur in advanced cases. HFM and other rare etiologies of folate deficiency may be further associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, severe infections, failure to thrive, neurologic abnormalities, and cog- nitive delays. LABORATORY FINDINGS The anemia is macrocytic (mean corpuscular volume >100 fL). Varia- tions in RBC shape and size are common (see Chapter 496, Fig. 496.4B). The reticulocyte count is low, and nucleated RBCs with megaloblastic morphology are often seen in the peripheral blood. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may be present, particularly in patients with long-­ standing and severe deficiencies. The neutrophils are large, some with hypersegmented nuclei (see Fig. 503.1). The bone marrow is hypercel- lular because of erythroid hyperplasia, and megaloblastic changes are prominent. Large, abnormal neutrophilic forms (giant metamyelo- cytes) with cytoplasmic vacuolation are also seen. Levels of RBC folate are a better indicator of chronic deficiency than serum folic acid levels. The normal RBC folate level is 150-­600 ng/mL of packed cells. Levels of iron and vitamin B12 in serum usually are normal or elevated. Serum activity of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis, is markedly elevated. TREATMENT When the diagnosis of folate deficiency is established, folic acid may be administered orally or parenterally at 0.5-­1.0 mg/day. If the specific diagnosis is in doubt, smaller doses of folate (0.1 mg/day) may be used for 1 week as a diagnostic test because a hematologic response can be expected within 72 hours. Doses of folate >0.1 mg can correct the ane- mia of vitamin B12 deficiency but might aggravate any associated neu- rologic abnormalities. In most medical settings in developed countries, this therapeutic trial to distinguish the different causes of megaloblastic anemia is rarely necessary because vitamin B12 and folate blood levels are usually readily available. Folic acid therapy (0.5-­1.0 mg/day) should be continued for 3-­4 weeks until a definite hematologic response has occurred. Maintenance therapy with a multivitamin (containing 0.2 mg of folate) is adequate. Parenteral or high doses of specific folate for- mulations are required in the setting of HFM. Transfusions are indi- cated only when the anemia is severe, or the child is very ill.

Thornburg Vitamin B12, a generic term encompassing all biologically active cobal- amins, is a water-­soluble vitamin with a central, functional cobalt atom and a planar corrin ring. Methylcobalamin and adenosyl cobalamin are the metabolically active derivatives, serving as cofactors in two essential metabolic reactions: methylation of homocysteine to methionine (via methionine synthase) and conversion of methyl-­malonyl-­coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl CoA (via l-­methyl-­malonyl-­CoA mutase). The products and by-­products of these enzymatic reactions are critical to DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Cobalamin (Cbl) is synthesized exclusively by microorganisms, and humans must rely on dietary sources (animal products, including meat, eggs, fish, and milk) for their needs (see Chapter 67.7). Unlike folate, older children and adults have sufficient vitamin B12 stores to last 3-­5 years. In young infants born to mothers with low vitamin B12 stores, clinical signs of Cbl deficiency can become apparent in the first 6-­18 months of life. METABOLISM Under normal circumstances, cobalamin is released from food protein in the stomach through peptic digestion. Cbl then binds to haptocorrin (HC), a salivary glycoprotein. This complex moves into the duodenum, where HC is digested by pancreatic proteases and Cbl is liberated. Cbl then binds to intrinsic factor (IF), another glycoprotein that is produced by gastric parietal cells. The Cbl-­IF complex subsequently enters mucosal cells of the distal ileum by receptor-­mediated endocytosis. Through a complex series of protein interactions, Cbl is taken up into the blood stream and taken up into cells. Cobalamins are processed in the cytoplasm to a common intermediate that can be allocated to the methylcobalamin and adenosyl- cobalamin synthesis pathways to meet cellular needs. ETIOLOGY Vitamin B12 deficiency can result from inadequate dietary intake of Cbl, lack of IF, impaired intestinal absorption of IF-­Cbl, inactivation, or absence of vitamin B12 transport protein (see Table 503.1). Inadequate Vitamin B12 Intake Vitamin B12 deficiency in infants is most often nutritional, resulting from low Cbl levels in the breast milk of B12-­deficient mothers. Associ- ated megaloblastic anemia often appears during the first year of life. Maternal deficiency may be caused by pernicious anemia or gastroin- testinal disorders such as Helicobacter pylori infection, celiac disease, Crohn disease, or pancreatic insufficiency. Previous gastric bypass sur- gery, treatment with proton pump inhibitors, and inadequate intake from a strict unsupplemented vegetarian diet have also been impli- cated. Fortunately, because of active placental Cbl transport in utero, most children of B12-­deficient mothers maintain Cbl levels sufficient to support adequate prenatal development. Such infants are born with low B12 stores, the depletion of which is associated with a gradual onset of clinical manifestations. Vitamin B12 replacement often results in rapid improvement, but the longer the deficient period, the greater the likelihood of permanent disabilities. Neonatal screening programs may detect maternal-­neonatal nutritional B12 deficiency because of an increase in propionyl carnitine, but there is higher sensitivity using a measurement of methylmalonic acid. In high-­income countries, dietary deficiency during childhood or adolescence is infrequent but can result from strict vegetarian or vegan diet. Daily requirements range from 0.4-­2.4 μg. Impaired Vitamin B12 Absorption Gastric surgery or medications that impair gastric acid secretion may result in IF deficiency, leading to decreased vitamin B12 absorption. Pancreatic insufficiency can also lead to Cbl deficiency because of impaired cleavage and IF complex formation. Patients with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or surgical removal of the terminal ileum may also have impaired absorption of vitamin B12. An overgrowth of intestinal bacteria within diverticula or duplications of the small intestine can cause vitamin B12 deficiency by consumption of (or competition for) the vitamin or by splitting of its complex with IF. In these cases, hematologic response can follow appropriate antibiotic therapy. In endemic areas, when the fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum infests the upper small intestine, similar mechanisms may be operative. When megaloblastic anemia occurs in such situations, the serum vitamin B12 level is low, and the gastric fluid contains IF.

Chapter 503  u  Megaloblastic Anemias  2943 Hereditary intrinsic factor deficiency (HIFD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a variety of pathologic genetic variants in the IF gene that produce a lack of gastric IF or a functionally abnormal IF. HIFD differs from typical adult pernicious anemia in that gastric acid is secreted normally and the stomach is histologically normal. It is not associated with antibodies or endocrine abnormalities. Unlike Imerslund-­Grasbeck syndrome, described next, HIFD is only occa- sionally associated with proteinuria. Symptoms become prominent at an early age (6-­24 months), consistent with exhaustion of vitamin B12 stores acquired in utero. As the anemia becomes severe, weakness, irri- tability, anorexia, and listlessness occur. The tongue is smooth, red, and painful. Neurologic manifestations include ataxia, paresthesias, hypo- reflexia, Babinski responses, and clonus. Oral vitamin B12 is usually ineffective, and lifelong intramuscular (IM) or intranasal Cbl should be used to bypass the absorption defect. The natural form, OHCbl, is believed to be more effective than the synthetic form, cyanocobalamin (CNCbl). Imerslund-­Grasbeck syndrome is a rare, recessively inherited pedi- atric disorder resulting in selective vitamin B12 malabsorption in the ileum and consequent vitamin B12 deficiency. It usually becomes clini- cally apparent within the first 6 years of life. In addition to megaloblastic anemia, the patient may also have neurologic defects (e.g., hypotonia, developmental delay, brain atrophy, movement disorders, dementia) and/or proteinuria. Patients carry pathologic variants in genes CUBN or AMN, which encode proteins that form the cubam receptor for the ileal IF-­Cbl complex. Because CUBN is also a key receptor for protein reabsorption in the kidney, impaired expression at this site results in associated proteinuria. The disease can be fatal if it remains untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment with IM or intranasal Cbl will reverse the hematologic and neurologic abnormalities. Proteinuria does not respond to therapy. Classic pernicious anemia (autoimmune gastritis) usually occurs in older adults but can rarely affect children. This disorder (juvenile per- nicious anemia) usually presents during adolescence. In such cases, the disease is associated with various detectable antibodies, including those against IF and the hydrogen-­potassium adenosine triphospha- tase proton pump in gastric parietal cells. These children can have additional immunologic abnormalities, cutaneous candidiasis, hypo- parathyroidism, and other endocrine deficiencies; atrophy of the gas- tric mucosa and achlorhydria may occur. IM or intranasal vitamin B12 should be administered regularly. Absence of Vitamin B12 Transport Protein Transcobalamin Transcobalamin (TC) deficiency is a rare cause of megaloblastic ane- mia. A congenital deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition resulting in a failure to absorb and transport vitamin B12. Most patients lack TC, but some have functionally defective forms. This disorder usually manifests in the first weeks of life. Characteris- tically, there is failure to thrive, diarrhea, vomiting, glossitis, neuro- logic abnormalities, and megaloblastic anemia. The diagnosis can be difficult given that total serum vitamin B12 levels are often normal because approximately 80% of serum Cbl is bound to HC. The diagno- sis is suggested by the presence of severe megaloblastic anemia in the face of normal folate levels and no evidence of another inborn error of metabolism. Plasma homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are elevated. A definitive diagnosis is made by measuring plasma TC. The serum vitamin B12 levels must be kept high to force enough Cbl into cells and allow normal function using high-­dose oral supplemen- tation or IM or intranasal treatment. Symptoms and laboratory studies should be monitored, and doses adjusted as needed. Disorders of Intracellular Cobalamin Metabolism Disorders of intracellular cobalamin metabolism are associated with pathologic genetic variants in genes associated with lettered comple- mentation groups. These include MMACHC (cblC), MMADHC (cblD-­ combined and cblD homocystinuria), MTRR (cblE), LMBRD1 (cblF), MTR (cblG), ABCD4 (cblJ), THAP11 (cblX-­like), ZNF143 (cblX-­like), or HCFC1 (cblX, which can show a cblC complementation class). The disorders present at a range of ages starting in utero and have a variable clinical presentation including complications of methylmalonic acide- mia, homocystinuria, and megaloblastic anemia. Patients require care with a metabolic specialist to guide treatment with OHCbl, avoidance of agents that can cause metabolic decompensation, and surveillance for complications. Vitamin B12 deficiency may develop by inactivation of vitamin B12. This most often occurs in adolescents who chronically use “Whippets,” which contain nitrous oxide, as a recreational agent to get high. Con- versely, patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency may have an exacerbation after nitrous oxide anesthesia. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Children with Cbl deficiency often present with nonspecific manifesta- tions such as weakness, lethargy, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and irritability. Other common findings include pallor, glossitis, vomit- ing, diarrhea, and icterus. Hyperpigmentation is another feature that may mimic Addison disease. Neurologic symptoms can include par- esthesia, sensory deficits, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, developmental regression, neuropsychiatric changes, and brain/spine MRI changes. Neurologic problems from vitamin B12 deficiency may occur in the absence of any hematologic abnormalities. Thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare manifestation. LABORATORY FINDINGS The hematologic manifestations of folate and Cbl deficiency are identi- cal. The anemia resulting from Cbl deficiency is macrocytic, with prom- inent macro-­ovalocytosis of the RBCs (see Chapter 496, Fig. 496.2, and Fig. 503.1). The neutrophils may be large and hypersegmented (see Fig. 503.1). In advanced cases, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can occur, simulating aplastic anemia or leukemia. Macrocytosis may not always be present. Serum vitamin B12 levels are low, and the serum concentrations of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine are elevated. Concentrations of serum iron and serum folic acid are normal or ele- vated. Serum lactate dehydrogenase activity is markedly increased, a reflection of ineffective erythropoiesis. Moderate elevations of serum bilirubin levels (2-­3 mg/dL) also may be found. Excessive excretion of methylmalonic acid in the urine (normal: 0-­3.5 mg/24 hr) is a reliable and sensitive index of vitamin B12 deficiency and is especially helpful when the serum vitamin B12 level is in the low-­normal range. DIAGNOSIS A comprehensive medical history is essential to the clinical recognition of possible Cbl deficiency. Information regarding clinical symptoms, dietary history, diseases, surgeries, or medications and drugs is likely to provide important clues. The physical examination may reveal relevant findings such as irritability, pallor, pigmentation or specific neurologic symptoms. Screening laboratory findings offer important informa- tion, but more focused testing will be required to confirm a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency and its cause. Cbl deficiency is usually identi- fied by measuring total or TC-­bound vitamin B12 in the blood. Although an extremely low level is generally diagnostic, this may not be the case because false negatives and false positives are reportedly common using currently available assays. As a result, it is wise not to discount vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in the face of clinical symptoms, macrocytic anemia, an abnormal blood smear, and a normal folate level. In untreated patients, methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine levels are often help- ful because they are greatly elevated in the majority of those with clinical signs of B12 deficiency. Excessive urinary methylmalonic acid excretion is also a sensitive test of B12 deficiency. Although modest increases occur with renal failure, elevated methylmalonic acid is otherwise quite specific for B12 deficiency. Notably, however, serum homocysteine is also elevated in folate deficiency, homocystinuria, and renal failure. If vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed and there is no evi- dence of inadequate dietary intake or, in the case of an infant, inad- equate maternal B12, malabsorption should be investigated. Anti-­IF antibodies and anti–parietal cell antibodies are useful for the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Measurement of IF and testing from more spe- cialized laboratories may be required for less common disorders.

The cause of vitamin B12 deficiency should ultimately dictate treatment dosage and route of administration as well as the duration of therapy. Cyano- cobalamin is available as a nasal spray as an alternative to parenteral injection. Dose adjustments should be made in response to clinical status and laboratory values. The physiologic requirement for vitamin B12 is about 1-­3 μg/day. Hematologic responses have been observed with small doses, indicating that a mini-­dose may be administered as a therapeutic test when the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is in doubt or in circumstances where the anemia is severe and higher initial doses might result in severe metabolic disturbances.

Thornburg Orotic aciduria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that usually appears in the first year of life and is characterized by growth failure, developmen- tal delay, megaloblastic anemia, and increased urinary excretion of orotic acid (see Chapter 110). Rarely, orotic aciduria occurs without megalo- blastic anemia. This defect is the most common metabolic error in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and therefore affects nucleic acid synthe- sis. The usual form of hereditary orotic aciduria is caused by a deficiency (in all body tissues) of orotic phosphoribosyl transferase and orotidine-­ 5-­phosphate decarboxylase, two sequential enzymatic steps in pyrimi- dine nucleotide synthesis. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of severe megaloblastic anemia with normal serum B12 and folate levels and no evidence of TC deficiency. A presumptive diagnosis is made by find- ing increased urinary orotic acid. However, confirmation of the diagnosis requires assay of the transferase and decarboxylase enzymes in the patient’s erythrocytes. Failure to thrive and intellectual disability often accompany this condition. The anemia is refractory to vitamin B12 or folic acid, but the anemia responds promptly to administration of uridine. Thiamine-­responsive megaloblastic anemia (Rogers syndrome) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by megaloblastic anemia, sensorineural deafness, and diabetes mellitus. Congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, visual problems, short stature, trilineage myelodys- plasia, and strokes are also described. Thiamine-­responsive megaloblastic anemia usually presents in infancy but may occasionally develop in child- hood and adolescence and occurs in several ethnically distinct popula- tions. The bone marrow is characterized not only by megaloblastic changes but also by ringed sideroblasts. The defect is caused by biallelic pathologic genetic variants in SCL19A2, which encodes a high-­affinity plasma mem- brane thiamine transporter. Continuous thiamine supplementation usu- ally reverses the anemia and diabetes, but not existing hearing defects. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. Iron deficiency is the most widespread and common nutritional dis- order in the world. It is estimated that 30–50% of the global population has iron-­deficiency anemia, and most of these individuals live in devel- oping countries. In the United States, 8–14% of children ages 12-­36 months are iron deficient, and 30% of this group progresses to iron-­ deficiency anemia. Chapter 504 Iron-­Deficiency Anemia Jennifer A. Rothman A full-­term newborn infant contains about 0.5 grams of iron, com- pared with 5 grams of iron in adults. This change in quantity of iron from birth to adulthood means that an average of 0.8 mg of iron must be absorbed each day during the first 15 years of life. A small additional amount is necessary to balance normal losses of iron by shedding of cells. It is therefore necessary to absorb approximately 1 mg daily to maintain positive iron balance in childhood. Because <10% of dietary iron is usu- ally absorbed, a dietary intake of 8-­10 mg of iron daily is necessary to maintain iron levels. During infancy, when growth is most rapid, the 1 mg/L of iron in cow’s and breast milk makes it difficult to maintain body iron. Although breastfed infants have an advantage because they absorb iron 2-­3 times more efficiently than infants fed cow’s milk, breastfed infants nonetheless are at risk of developing iron deficiency without regular intake of iron-­fortified foods by 6 months of age. ETIOLOGY Most iron in neonates resides in circulating hemoglobin. As the rela- tively high hemoglobin concentration of the newborn infant falls dur- ing the first 2-­3 months of life, considerable iron is recycled. These iron stores are usually sufficient for blood formation in the first 6-­9 months of life in term infants. Stores are depleted sooner in premature infants, low birthweight infants, or infants with perinatal blood loss, because their iron stores are smaller. Delayed (1-­3 minute) clamping of the umbilical cord can improve iron status and reduce the risk of iron deficiency, whereas early clamping (<30 seconds) puts the infant at risk for iron deficiency. Dietary sources of iron are especially impor- tant in these infants. In term infants, anemia caused solely by inad- equate dietary iron usually occurs at 9-­24 months of age and is less common thereafter. The usual dietary pattern observed in infants and toddlers with nutritional iron-­deficiency anemia in developed coun- tries is excessive consumption of cow’s milk (low iron content, blood loss from milk protein colitis) in a child who is often overweight or bottle feeding beyond 12 months of age. Worldwide, undernutrition is usually responsible for iron deficiency (Table 504.1). Blood loss must be considered as a possible cause in every case of iron-­deficiency anemia. Sources of blood loss, particularly in older children and adolescents, include menstrual losses, recurrent nose- bleeds, or intravascular hemolysis with hemoglobinuria, as seen in dis- eases such as malaria or endurance athletics such as triathletes. Chronic iron-­deficiency anemia from occult bleeding may be caused by a lesion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as peptic ulcer, Meckel diver- ticulum, polyp, hemangioma, or inflammatory bowel disease. Infants can have chronic intestinal blood loss induced by exposure to cow’s milk protein. Involved infants characteristically develop anemia that is more severe and occurs earlier than would be expected simply from an inadequate intake of iron. The ongoing loss of blood in the stools can be prevented either by breastfeeding or by delaying the introduc- tion of whole cow’s milk in the first years of life and then limiting the quantity to <24 oz/24 hours. Infants and toddlers who have excessive raw milk intake with no iron supplementation and limited iron contain- ing foods are at high risk of iron deficiency. Unrecognized blood loss also can be associated with chronic diarrhea and, rarely, with pulmonary hemosiderosis. In developing countries, infections with hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, and Plasmodium often contribute to iron deficiency. Since iron is absorbed in the proximal duodenum with the assistance of gastric acid, gastric bypass procedures or Helicobacter pylori infec- tion may interfere with iron absorption. Similarly, inflammation of the bowel from celiac disease and giardiasis may also interfere with iron absorption. Approximately 2% of adolescent females have iron-­deficiency ane- mia, largely as a result of their adolescent growth spurt and menstrual blood loss. The highest risk of iron-­deficiency anemia (>30%) is among teenagers who are or have been pregnant. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Most children with iron-­deficiency anemia are asymptomatic and are identified by routine laboratory screening at 9-­12 months of age. Nor- mal hemoglobin values vary according to age, gender, ethnicity, and method of testing, such as capillary versus venous blood.

The cause of vitamin B12 deficiency should ultimately dictate treatment dosage and route of administration as well as the duration of therapy. Cyano- cobalamin is available as a nasal spray as an alternative to parenteral injection. Dose adjustments should be made in response to clinical status and laboratory values. The physiologic requirement for vitamin B12 is about 1-­3 μg/day. Hematologic responses have been observed with small doses, indicating that a mini-­dose may be administered as a therapeutic test when the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is in doubt or in circumstances where the anemia is severe and higher initial doses might result in severe metabolic disturbances.

Thornburg Orotic aciduria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that usually appears in the first year of life and is characterized by growth failure, developmen- tal delay, megaloblastic anemia, and increased urinary excretion of orotic acid (see Chapter 110). Rarely, orotic aciduria occurs without megalo- blastic anemia. This defect is the most common metabolic error in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and therefore affects nucleic acid synthe- sis. The usual form of hereditary orotic aciduria is caused by a deficiency (in all body tissues) of orotic phosphoribosyl transferase and orotidine-­ 5-­phosphate decarboxylase, two sequential enzymatic steps in pyrimi- dine nucleotide synthesis. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of severe megaloblastic anemia with normal serum B12 and folate levels and no evidence of TC deficiency. A presumptive diagnosis is made by find- ing increased urinary orotic acid. However, confirmation of the diagnosis requires assay of the transferase and decarboxylase enzymes in the patient’s erythrocytes. Failure to thrive and intellectual disability often accompany this condition. The anemia is refractory to vitamin B12 or folic acid, but the anemia responds promptly to administration of uridine. Thiamine-­responsive megaloblastic anemia (Rogers syndrome) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by megaloblastic anemia, sensorineural deafness, and diabetes mellitus. Congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, visual problems, short stature, trilineage myelodys- plasia, and strokes are also described. Thiamine-­responsive megaloblastic anemia usually presents in infancy but may occasionally develop in child- hood and adolescence and occurs in several ethnically distinct popula- tions. The bone marrow is characterized not only by megaloblastic changes but also by ringed sideroblasts. The defect is caused by biallelic pathologic genetic variants in SCL19A2, which encodes a high-­affinity plasma mem- brane thiamine transporter. Continuous thiamine supplementation usu- ally reverses the anemia and diabetes, but not existing hearing defects. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Because hepcidin production is induced by inflammatory stimuli, hepcidin elevation is also a feature of the anemia of chronic disease (ACD). However, in contrast to patients with IRIDA, in whom the hepcidin dysregulation is congenital, patients with ACD generally retain normal to high iron stores because of the acquired nature of their hepcidin elevation (see Chapter 500.1). Rare medical causes that may mimic IRIDA include vascular malformations of the GI tract, Castleman disease (where IL-­6 overproduction causes hepcidin elevation), autoimmune gastritis, and pathogenic germline variants in KCNQ1 (which regulates gastric acid secretion). TREATMENT Because of the underlying pathophysiology of IRIDA, parenteral iron supplementation is required to correct the anemia. Although parenteral iron therapy raises body iron stores, the hematologic response is usually slow and not completely corrective. This likely results from insufficient export of the processed iron from macrophages into the circulation, an expected consequence of hepcidin elevation. Serum ferritin levels increase with parenteral iron therapy in a dose-­dependent manner and may raise concerns for iron overload, which would be expected to exhibit a reticuloendothelial rather than a parenchymal pattern of iron loading. Given the limited number of IRIDA cases reported to date, the optimal formulation and dosing of parenteral iron have not yet been established. Although oral iron supplementation does not appear to have a significant role in treatment of IRIDA, the addition of ascor- bic acid to a ferrous sulfate oral supplement has been associated with hematologic responses in isolated cases. Treatment with recombinant erythropoietin has not been found to produce significant clinical ben- efit in patients with IRIDA. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. A number of rare microcytic anemias need to be considered when children with microcytic anemia fail to respond to oral iron (Table 504.5). These anemias include thalassemia or thalassemia trait (see ­Chapter 511), infantile poikilocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilo- cytosis (Chapter 508), and anemia of chronic disease (Chapter 500.1). Additionally, rare nutritional disorders and disorders of iron metabo- lism can cause microcytosis. INFANTILE POIKILOCYTOSIS AND HEREDITARY PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS Infants with common hereditary elliptocytosis (see Chapter 508) may initially present with hemolytic anemia characterized by marked poikilocytosis with budding and fragmentation of the red blood cells (RBCs). These small RBC fragments reduce the overall mean corpus- cular volume (MCV), resulting in microcytosis. By 2 years of age, the findings become typical of hereditary elliptocytosis. Hereditary pyro- poikilocytosis is a much less common variant of hereditary elliptocy- tosis, in which the hemolytic anemia and RBC changes are more severe. COPPER DEFICIENCY Copper deficiency is a rare cause of microcytic anemia and neuro- logic dysfunction. Copper is absorbed in the stomach and proximal Chapter 505 Other Microcytic Anemias Jennifer A. Rothman duodenum. Deficiency is associated with malabsorption; severe mal- nutrition, often with feeding of milk alone; gastric surgery or feed- ings that bypass the stomach and duodenum; or parenteral nutrition with inadvertent omission of supplemental copper. Zinc and copper are competitively absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, so zinc excess may inadvertently lead to copper deficiency. Diagnosis is made by measuring a serum copper level, serum ceruloplasmin, and possibly a zinc level. Treatment includes either oral or parenteral supplementa- tion, depending on the underlying cause. DEFECTS OF IRON METABOLISM Rare microcytic anemias may be associated with defects in iron traf- ficking and regulation. Most are inherited and usually identified in childhood, including defects of iron absorption, transport, utiliza- tion, and recycling. A defect of iron absorption is iron-­refractory iron-­ deficiency anemia (see Chapter 504.1). Defects of iron recycling include aceruloplasminemia and atransferrinemia. Aceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disorder in the CP gene that encodes ceruloplas- min. Iron cannot be appropriately transported from macrophages to plasma to be available for RBC production but accumulates instead in the brain and visceral organs, which can lead to an adult-­onset neu- rodegenerative disorder. The diagnosis is made by a combination of absence of serum ceruloplasmin, low serum copper and iron, elevated ferritin, and increased liver iron concentration. Hypotransferrinemia or atransferrinemia is also an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the transferrin (TF) gene. Diagnosis is made by low or absent serum transferrin and liver iron overload. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis for both disorders. Treatment includes iron chelation therapy, limiting iron supplementation and dietary iron, and possibly fresh-­frozen plasma to replace ceruloplasmin and/or transfer- rin. Purified transferrin (apotransferrin) infusions are available. Defects of mitochondrial iron utilization are a diverse group of acquired and inherited defects known as sideroblastic anemias (Table 505.1). Several genes associated with these disorders have been described. Impaired heme synthesis leads to retention of iron within the mitochondria of marrow RBCs. The perinuclear distribution of mitochondria results in a pattern of iron staining surrounding the nucleus. These are ringed sideroblasts (Fig. 505.1), which are distinct from the more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of iron in normal RBC precursors. The anemia is characterized by hypochromic, microcytic RBCs mixed with normal RBCs, so the complete blood count indi- cates a very high RBC distribution width. The serum iron concen- tration usually is elevated, and the transferrin saturation of iron is increased. Congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) can be syndromic or nonsyndromic. The most common type of nonsyndromic CSA is an X-­linked disorder and is most often a result of pathogenic variants in ALAS2 that encodes erythrocytic isozyme 5-­aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the rate-­limiting enzyme reaction in heme synthesis. An important cofactor for 5-­ALA synthetase is pyridoxal phosphate, with several pathogenic variants occurring near its binding site. Severe anemia is recognized in infancy or early childhood, whereas milder cases might not become apparent until early adulthood or later. Clini- cal findings include pallor, icterus, and moderate splenomegaly and/ or hepatomegaly. The severity of the anemia varies such that some patients require no therapy and others need regular RBC transfusions. A subset of patients with hereditary sideroblastic anemia manifest a hematologic response to pyridoxine doses of 50-­200 mg/day. Iron overload, as manifested by elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum iron, and increased transferrin saturation, is a major complication of this disorder. Clinical evidence of iron overload (e.g., diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction) may be found in some patients who have little or no anemia, which may require iron chelation therapy. Stem cell transplan- tation has been used to treat affected children who are dependent on RBC transfusions. A unique variant of congenital sideroblastic anemia is Pearson syn- drome (see Chapter 498), but the anemia is usually macrocytic and not microcytic. Another rare variant of sideroblastic anemia is caused by pathogenic variants in TRNT1 and manifests with developmental Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

Section 3 Hemolytic Anemias Chapter 506 Definitions and Classification of Hemolytic Anemias Stephanie Prozora and Patrick G. Gallagher Hemolysis is defined as the premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs). Anemia results when the rate of destruction exceeds the capacity of the marrow to produce additional RBCs. Normal RBC sur- vival time is 110-­120 days (half-­life: 55-­60 days), and thus, approxi- mately 0.85% of the most senescent RBCs are removed and replaced each day. During hemolysis, RBC survival is shortened, the RBC count falls, erythropoietin is increased, and marrow erythropoietic activity is stimulated. This leads to compensatory erythroid hyperplasia with increased RBC production, reflected by an increase in the reticulocyte count. The marrow can increase its output twofold to threefold acutely, with a maximum of sixfold to eightfold in chronic hemolysis. The reticulocyte percentage can be corrected to measure the magnitude of marrow production in response to hemolysis as follows: Reticulocyte index = reticulocyte % × Observed hematocrit Normal hematocrit × 1 μ where μ is a maturation factor of 1-­3 related to the severity of the anemia (Fig. 506.1). The normal reticulocyte index is 1.0; therefore the index measures the fold increase in erythropoiesis (e.g., twofold, three- fold). Because the reticulocyte index is essentially a measure of RBC production per day, the maturation factor μ provides this correction (see Fig. 506.1). When hemolysis is chronic, compensatory erythroid hyperpla- sia may lead to significant expansion of the medullary spaces at the expense of cortical bone. This is particularly prominent in children with severe chronic hemolytic anemia such as thalassemia. These changes may be evident on physical examination or on radiographs of the skull and long bones. In severe cases, there is increased propensity for long bone fracture. Hemolysis also leads to increased degradation of hemoglobin. This process can result in indirect hyperbilirubinemia, increased biliary excretion of heme pigment derivatives, and formation of bilirubinate gallstones. During hemolysis (Fig. 506.2), heme-­binding proteins in the plasma are altered. Hemoglobin binds to haptoglobin and hemopexin, both of which are cleared more rapidly as heme-­bound complexes. Oxidized heme binds to albumin to form methemalbumin, which is increased in the plasma during hemolysis. When the capacity of these heme-­ binding molecules is exceeded, free hemoglobin appears in the plasma. Free hemoglobin in the plasma is considered prima facie evidence of Percent MATURATION TIME - DAYS 3.5 45 1.0 3.0 35 1.5 2.5 25 2.0 1.5 15 2.5 Marrow normoblasts and reticulocytes Blood reticulocytes Hematocrit Fig. 506.1  Number of days for maturation of reticulocytes to mature erythrocytes in the marrow and blood.

The most common type of nonsyndromic CSA is an X-­linked disorder and is most often a result of pathogenic variants in ALAS2 that encodes erythrocytic isozyme 5-­aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the rate-­limiting enzyme reaction in heme synthesis. An important cofactor for 5-­ALA synthetase is pyridoxal phosphate, with several pathogenic variants occurring near its binding site. Severe anemia is recognized in infancy or early childhood, whereas milder cases might not become apparent until early adulthood or later. Clini- cal findings include pallor, icterus, and moderate splenomegaly and/ or hepatomegaly. The severity of the anemia varies such that some patients require no therapy and others need regular RBC transfusions. A subset of patients with hereditary sideroblastic anemia manifest a hematologic response to pyridoxine doses of 50-­200 mg/day. Iron overload, as manifested by elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum iron, and increased transferrin saturation, is a major complication of this disorder. Clinical evidence of iron overload (e.g., diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction) may be found in some patients who have little or no anemia, which may require iron chelation therapy. Stem cell transplan- tation has been used to treat affected children who are dependent on RBC transfusions. A unique variant of congenital sideroblastic anemia is Pearson syn- drome (see Chapter 498), but the anemia is usually macrocytic and not microcytic.

Section 3 Hemolytic Anemias Chapter 506 Definitions and Classification of Hemolytic Anemias Stephanie Prozora and Patrick G. Gallagher Hemolysis is defined as the premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs). Anemia results when the rate of destruction exceeds the capacity of the marrow to produce additional RBCs. Normal RBC sur- vival time is 110-­120 days (half-­life: 55-­60 days), and thus, approxi- mately 0.85% of the most senescent RBCs are removed and replaced each day. During hemolysis, RBC survival is shortened, the RBC count falls, erythropoietin is increased, and marrow erythropoietic activity is stimulated. This leads to compensatory erythroid hyperplasia with increased RBC production, reflected by an increase in the reticulocyte count. The marrow can increase its output twofold to threefold acutely, with a maximum of sixfold to eightfold in chronic hemolysis. The reticulocyte percentage can be corrected to measure the magnitude of marrow production in response to hemolysis as follows: Reticulocyte index = reticulocyte % × Observed hematocrit Normal hematocrit × 1 μ where μ is a maturation factor of 1-­3 related to the severity of the anemia (Fig. 506.1). The normal reticulocyte index is 1.0; therefore the index measures the fold increase in erythropoiesis (e.g., twofold, three- fold). Because the reticulocyte index is essentially a measure of RBC production per day, the maturation factor μ provides this correction (see Fig. 506.1). When hemolysis is chronic, compensatory erythroid hyperpla- sia may lead to significant expansion of the medullary spaces at the expense of cortical bone. This is particularly prominent in children with severe chronic hemolytic anemia such as thalassemia. These changes may be evident on physical examination or on radiographs of the skull and long bones. In severe cases, there is increased propensity for long bone fracture. Hemolysis also leads to increased degradation of hemoglobin. This process can result in indirect hyperbilirubinemia, increased biliary excretion of heme pigment derivatives, and formation of bilirubinate gallstones. During hemolysis (Fig. 506.2), heme-­binding proteins in the plasma are altered. Hemoglobin binds to haptoglobin and hemopexin, both of which are cleared more rapidly as heme-­bound complexes. Oxidized heme binds to albumin to form methemalbumin, which is increased in the plasma during hemolysis. When the capacity of these heme-­ binding molecules is exceeded, free hemoglobin appears in the plasma. Free hemoglobin in the plasma is considered prima facie evidence of Percent MATURATION TIME - DAYS 3.5 45 1.0 3.0 35 1.5 2.5 25 2.0 1.5 15 2.5 Marrow normoblasts and reticulocytes Blood reticulocytes Hematocrit Fig. 506.1  Number of days for maturation of reticulocytes to mature erythrocytes in the marrow and blood.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common cause of inherited hemolytic anemia, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 2,000-­ 5,000 persons. Described in patients of all ethnic groups, it is the most common inherited abnormality of the erythrocyte associated with inherited hemolytic anemia in persons of Northern European origin. HS is marked by wide variability in the associated clinical, laboratory, and genetic manifestations. Symptomatology ranges from asymptomatic patients with well-­compensated anemia to severely affected patients with hemolytic anemia requiring regular blood transfusions. ETIOLOGY The pathophysiology underlying HS is twofold: an intrinsic defect of the erythrocyte membrane and an intact spleen that selectively retains, damages, and removes abnormal HS erythrocytes. Quali- tative or quantitative defects of key membrane proteins lead to a multistep process of accelerated HS erythrocyte destruction. Chapter 507 Hereditary Spherocytosis Stephanie Prozora and Patrick G. Gallagher Abnormalities of ankyrin or spectrin are the most common molec- ular defects (Table 507.1). Defects in these membrane proteins result in uncoupling of the “vertical” interactions of the lipid bilayer with the underlying membrane skeleton with subsequent release of membrane microvesicles. The loss of membrane surface area with- out a proportional loss of cell volume causes decreased erythrocyte deformability. This impairs cell passage from the splenic cords to the splenic sinuses, leading to the trapping and premature destruc- tion of HS erythrocytes by the spleen (Figs. 507.1 and 507.2). Splenectomy markedly improves erythrocyte life span and may be indicated in some patients with HS. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Hereditary spherocytosis is usually transmitted as an autosomal domi- nant trait. However, as many as 25% of patients have no previous fam- ily history, representing either recessive inheritance or de novo gene variants. In the neonatal period, HS is a significant cause of hemolysis and can manifest as anemia and/or hyperbilirubinemia severe enough to require phototherapy, transfusion, or exchange transfusions. Hemolysis may be more prominent in the newborn because hemo- globin F binds 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate poorly, and the increased level of free 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate destabilizes interactions among spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1 in the red blood cell (RBC) mem- brane (see Fig. 507.1). The need for transfusions in infancy is not indicative of more severe disease later in life because infants are typically slow to mount an adequate reticulocyte response for the first few months after birth. Disease severity varies and can be used to clinically classify HS (Table 507.2). Mild cases (20–30% of all HS) are asymptomatic into adulthood and have well-­compensated mild anemia where reticulocyte production and erythrocyte destruction are essentially balanced. Cases of moderate or “typical” HS (60–70%) have partially compensated hemolytic anemia with reticulocytosis, frequently with symptoms of fatigue, pallor, and intermittent jaundice. Splenomegaly is common after infancy, and it is present in almost all HS patients by young adult- hood. Severe cases of HS (3–5%) have life-­threatening anemia and are transfusion dependent. Bilirubin gallstone formation is a function of age; they can form as early as 4-­5 years of age and are present in most adult HS patients. HS patients are susceptible to aplastic crises primarily as a result of parvovirus B19 infection, hypoplastic crises associated with other infections, and megaloblastic crises due to folate deficiency (Fig. 507.3). During these crises, high RBC turnover in the setting of erythroid mar- row failure can result in profound anemia (hematocrit <10%), high-­ output heart failure, cardiovascular collapse, and death. Leukocyte and platelet counts may also fall. Rare complications associated with HS include splenic seques- tration crisis, gout, cardiomyopathy, priapism, leg ulcers, and neurologic or muscular abnormalities, including spinocerebellar degeneration.

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of HS erythrocytes is low normal or even slightly decreased and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is usually increased (>35 g/dL). An MCHC > 35.4 g/dL combined with an RBC distribution width (RDW) <14% has been suggested as a screening test for HS. Erythroid cells on peripheral blood smear vary in size and include spherocytes and polychromatophilic reticulocytes. Spherocytes are smaller in diameter, hyperchromic due to elevated hemoglobin concentration from cellular dehydra- tion, and lacking in central pallor (Fig. 507.4). Numbers of sphe- rocytes are variable, with increased numbers likely reflecting the severity of disease. Other markers of hemolysis include decreased haptoglobin and elevated lactic dehydrogenase.

If these are present, no additional testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis clinically. If the diagnosis is less certain, additional testing can be performed. Binding of fluorescently labeled eosin-­5-­maleimide (EMA) to band 3 and other membrane proteins is decreased in HS erythro- cytes. This flow cytometry–based screening test is easy to perform and has good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In the classic incubated osmotic fragility test, HS erythrocytes are incubated in progressive dilutions of sodium chloride causing the cells to swell and lyse, with spherocytes lysing at a lower dilution due to their lower surface area to volume ratio. This test detects the presence of spherocytes in the blood, but it is not specific to HS and may be abnormal in other anemias with prominent spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility testing has poor sensitivity and may miss cases of mild HS where the numbers of spherocytes are few. Other assays such as the cryohemolysis test, the acidified glycerol lysis test, and the osmotic gradient ektacytometry have been used for diagnosis of HS, but they are not available in many laboratories. Genetic diagnosis is widely available on a commercial basis. The precise role of molecular testing in HS diagnosis and management is evolving. Some experts suggest molecular testing before splenectomy to verify the diagno- sis of HS. Diagnosis in the neonatal period requires a high index of sus- picion as the disease presents differently than in older children, particularly in de novo and recessively inherited cases where fam- ily history is not available for guidance. Jaundice is frequently observed, and kernicterus can occur. Hemolytic anemia may be severe enough to require blood transfusion. In fact, HS is the lead- ing cause of Coombs-­negative hemolytic anemia, requiring trans- fusion in the first months of life. Splenomegaly is uncommon in neonates. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The differential diagnosis for spherocytosis on peripheral blood smear includes isoimmune and autoimmune hemolysis. Isoimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn, particularly when there is a result of ABO incompatibility, closely mimics the appearance of HS. The detection of antibody on an infant's RBCs using a direct anti- globulin (Coombs) test should establish the diagnosis of immune hemolysis. Autoimmune hemolytic anemias also are characterized by spherocytosis, but there will typically be evidence of previously normal values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte count. Rare causes of spherocytosis include thermal injury, hemolytic transfusion reaction, clostridial sepsis, severe hypophosphatemia, Wilson disease, and snake, bee, or wasp envenomation, which all may manifest as transient spherocytic hemolytic anemia. TREATMENT General Supportive Care Infants born to a parent with known HS should be monitored care- fully because hyperbilirubinemia may peak several days after birth. Parents should be advised of the risk of neonatal anemia and jaun- dice and the potential need for transfusion, phototherapy, and/or exchange transfusion to treat anemia or hyperbilirubinemia. A sub- set of infants will be transfusion-­dependent until development of adequate erythropoiesis to compensate for the ongoing hemolysis, usually between 6-­12 months of age. Transfusion dependence after this time is rare and is most likely due to recessive HS. Once the baseline level of disease severity is reached, an annual visit to the hematologist usually is sufficient follow-­up. Growth should be monitored, and exercise tolerance and spleen size docu- mented. Vaccinations should be up to date. Screening for gallblad- der disease should begin at ∼4 years of age, repeated every 3-­5 years, or as indicated clinically. Documentation of parvovirus B19 susceptibility or immunity should be obtained in newly diagnosed patients. Similarly, HIV and hepatitis serology should be docu- mented in patients who have received transfusions. Folic acid sup- plementation is recommended in cases of moderate and severe HS due to the demands of brisk erythropoiesis. Parents should receive anticipatory guidance regarding the risk of aplastic crisis secondary to parvovirus infection and hypoplastic crises with other infections. Parents and patients should be informed of an increased risk for gallstone development. Guidelines for Splenectomy Because spherocytes are destroyed almost exclusively in the spleen, splenectomy is curative in most patients because hemolysis, anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and the incidence of gallstones are significantly lessened, if not completely eradicated, after splenectomy. Thus sple- nectomy became routine in the care of HS patients. However, sple- nectomy is associated with short-­term risks, related to the operative procedure itself, and long-­term risks, particularly increased lifelong Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

Chapter 507  u  Hereditary Spherocytosis  2959 When considering splenectomy, the patient and the parents, together with their healthcare providers, should review and consider the risks and benefits. Individual-­specific factors may confer additional risk after a splenectomy; time and distance from medical care in case of febrile illness and residence in or travel to areas where parasitic dis- eases such as malaria or babesiosis occur should be considered. Most experts recommend splenectomy for patients with severe HS and believe it should be strongly considered for patients with mod- erate HS and frequent hypoplastic or aplastic crises, poor growth, or cardiomegaly. It is generally not recommended for patients with mild HS. When splenectomy is indicated, it should be performed after the age of 6 years, if possible, to avoid the heightened risk of postsplenec- tomy sepsis in younger children. The laparoscopic approach has less surgical morbidity and has become the technique of choice. Partial or subtotal splenectomy (removal of 85–95% of spleen volume) has been shown to decrease the hemolytic rate while preserving some splenic phagocytic function, although the decrease in hemolysis is less than that achievable with total splenectomy. Partial splenectomy is most attractive in children with severe HS requiring frequent transfusion early in childhood. In children undergoing splenectomy, a concomitant cholecystec- tomy should be performed if there are gallstones. It is controversial whether to perform a concomitant splenectomy in less-­severely ill patients who are undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstone dis- ease. Postsplenectomy thrombocytosis is commonly observed but requires no treatment and usually resolves spontaneously. The patient should remain current on their vaccinations, as should household and frequent contacts. Prophylactic antibiotics are typically prescribed at least until the patient is 5 years of age or at least 2 years postsplenectomy. Folate supplementation should be continued if the hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count do not normalize. Splenectomy failure may occur in cases of accessory spleen, acci- dental autotransplantation of splenic tissue into peritoneum at time of surgery, inaccurate diagnosis, or another co-­inherited hemolytic ane- mia. Clues include return of hemolysis and disappearance of Howell-­ Jolly bodies on peripheral blood smear. The diagnosis can be made by radionucleotide studies.

Whereas hereditary spherocyto- sis is thought of as a disorder of the vertical interactions coupling the erythrocyte membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer, the HE syndromes interfere with the horizontal interactions that link spectrin molecules to each other and to membrane skeleton junctional complexes (see Chapter 507, Fig. 507.1), leaving the cell vulnerable to shear stress. HE is the prototypical member of the group, in which abnormal shear stress over time results in elliptical deformation of the cell. It is much more common than hereditary spherocytosis, but it is much less likely to cause significant clinical symptomatology. The severity of HE varies markedly, with most patients experiencing little or no symptom- atology beyond the finding of elliptocytes on peripheral blood smear. About 10% of patients have hemolytic HE with ongoing hemolysis and anemia. HE is often worse during infancy, with hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia that evolves to a well-­compensated state with anemia that is absent, sporadic, or chronic. Hereditary elliptocytosis occurs worldwide and in all ethnic groups, but it is more common in patients with ancestry linked to areas of endemic malaria. HPP is a subtype of HE characterized by severe hemolytic anemia with findings on peripheral blood smear reminiscent of a thermal burn (pyro, fire). HE and HPP are seen co-­segregating in the same families because they involve overlapping pathogenic variants in spectrin. HPP occurs predominantly in patients of African descent.

Chapter 509  u  Hereditary Stomatocytosis Syndromes  2961 Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is a disorder characterized by the presence of ovalocytes (less elongated and plumper than ellipto- cytes), some with one or two transverse ridges on peripheral smear. SAO is found in individuals from New Guinea, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Unlike HE and HPP, SAO is due to a variant in a transmembrane protein, band 3, affecting vertical skeletal interactions and leading to increased red cell rigidity. These changes may lead to protection from malaria, particularly cerebral malaria. ETIOLOGY Various molecular defects have been described in HE. HE is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with occasional de novo cases. Most commonly, there are missense pathogenic variants of α-­ or β-­ spectrin that interfere with the formation of spectrin heterodimers into tetramers, the primary structural unit of the membrane skeleton (see Fig. 507.1). Erythrocytes carrying many of these spectrin patho- genic variants are resistant to malaria in vitro, hypothesized to explain the increased prevalence of HE in malaria-­endemic areas. Less com- monly, elliptocytosis results from pathogenic variants in protein 4.1 or glycophorin C, proteins of the junctional complex that link spectrin tetramers to the actin cytoskeleton. These defects in horizontal mem- brane skeleton protein interactions leave the cell susceptible to shear- ing forces, leading to the characteristic elliptical deformation of the cell and potentially membrane fragmentation. In HPP, two abnormal spectrin alleles are inherited. Frequently, an HPP patient inherits an abnormal spectrin allele carrying a self-­association site missense variant from one parent, who has mild or asymptomatic HE, and a production-­defective allele that leads to quantitative deficiency of spectrin from the other parent, who is otherwise clinically well. SAO is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with an in-­ frame, nine amino acid deletion in band 3. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Most HE patients do not have clinically significant hemolysis (see Fig. 507.4B). HE may be an incidental finding on a blood film examina- tion for an unrelated indication. The diagnosis of HE is established by the findings on the peripheral blood smear, the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and the absence of other causes of elliptocytosis. The differential diagnosis for other causes of elliptocytosis includes deficiencies of iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12, thalassemia, myelodys- plastic syndromes, and pyruvate kinase deficiency. Interestingly, elliptocytes are not always present on the periph- eral blood smear in the first few months of life. Even in hemolytic HE, which may lead to neonatal jaundice and anemia, the peripheral blood smear typically shows bizarre poikilocytes and pyknocytes with rare to no elliptocytes. Hemolysis and anemia are aggravated in the newborn period because of the increased presence of hemoglobin F, which binds poorly to 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate. The increased free 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate tends to destabilize the spectrin–actin–protein 4.1 complex, leading to membrane instability (see Fig. 507.1). The usual features of a chronic hemolytic process due to hemolytic HE manifest as anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. Cholelithiasis may occur in later childhood and aplastic crises have been reported. HPP is characterized by extreme microcytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV], 50-­65 fL/ cell), extraordinary variation in cell size and shape, and microsphero- cytosis with occasional elliptocytosis (see Fig. 507.4C). Hemolysis is chronic and significant. SAO is associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, but it is associ- ated with little to no hemolysis later in life. LABORATORY FINDINGS Examination of the peripheral blood smear is essential to establish the diagnosis of HE (see Fig. 507.4B). HE elliptocytes are normochromic and normocytic with varying degrees of elongation. Because some HE patients may present with relatively low numbers of elliptocytes, there is no cutoff percentage that is useful diagnostically. In hemolytic HE, other abnormal RBC shapes may be present, depending on the sever- ity of hemolysis, including spherocytes, pyknocytes, and other poikilo- cytes. In HPP, microspherocytes, red cell fragments, and occasional elliptocytes are seen. SAO is suggested when ovalocytes, which in con- trast to elliptocytes are less elongated, are observed. Reticulocyte levels and other markers of hemolysis, such as total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin, are helpful in estab- lishing the severity of hemolysis, if present. In hemolytic HE and HPP, additional testing may include the eosin-­5-­maleimide (EMA) binding test, which detects binding to band 3 by flow cytometry, or incubated osmotic fragility testing. In cases of chronic hemolysis, splenomegaly and cholelithiasis can be assessed with abdominal ultrasound. TREATMENT If the presentation is that of typical HE (i.e., an isolated peripheral blood smear abnormality without clinically evident hemolysis), no treatment is necessary. For chronic HE and HPP, red blood cell transfusions are occasionally required. Splenectomy decreases the hemolysis and should be considered using criteria similar to that of hereditary spherocytosis. If hemolysis continues after splenectomy, patients should receive folic acid to prevent secondary folic acid deficiency. SAO does not require treatment beyond the newborn period.

The hereditary stomatocytosis syndromes are a group of heteroge- neous, dominantly inherited disorders in which alterations in red cell cation permeability lead to alterations in intracellular water content (Table 509.1). A net increase in sodium and potassium ions allows water to enter the erythrocyte, creating stomatocytes or hydrocytes, whereas a net loss of sodium and potassium ions leads to water loss, creating dehydrated red cells, or xerocytes (Fig. 509.1). HEREDITARY XEROCYTOSIS Pathophysiology Hereditary xerocytosis, the most common type of the hereditary stomatocytosis syndromes, is a dominant disorder of erythrocyte dehydration. The underlying defect is most commonly a missense variant in PIEZO1, a mechanosensory transduction protein, associ- ated with delayed channel inactivation. In a few patients, pathogenic variants in the Gardos channel, important in erythrocyte dehydra- tion in sickle cell disease, have been observed. Typically, there is a net loss of intracellular potassium that is not accompanied by a compensatory increase in sodium. Subsequently, the gradual loss of intracellular water leads to erythrocyte dehydration. Hereditary xerocytosis may be associated with a syndrome of hydrops fetalis with perinatal anemia and ascites. These findings are transient and remain unexplained. Clinical Features Affected patients exhibit a mild compensated macrocytic hemolytic anemia with variable degrees of splenomegaly and intermittent jaun- dice. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and mean cell volume (MCV) are elevated, and erythrocyte osmotic fragil- ity is decreased, as are potassium concentration and total monovalent cation content. There are small numbers of stomatocytes, target cells, and contracted red blood cells (RBCs) with hemoglobin puddled to the side on peripheral blood smear.

Because of the apparent predisposition to major thromboses postsplenectomy, sple- nectomy is not recommended in hereditary xerocytosis and related dis- orders. Another unusual manifestation of hereditary xerocytosis is the propensity for iron overload, independent of transfusion history. Thus iron indices should be monitored at regular intervals. HEREDITARY HYDROCYTOSIS Pathophysiology Hereditary hydrocytosis is a very rare, dominant disorder associated with large, swollen stomatocytic erythrocytes. The principal defect is an increase in Na+ and K+ permeability, leading to markedly increased intracellular sodium and water content. The molecular defect is unknown in most cases. In a subset of cases, missense variants in the Rh-­associated glycoprotein (RhAG) have been identified. Clinical Features Hereditary hydrocytosis is the most clinically severe disorder of altered erythrocyte volume regulation. It is characterized by moderate to severe hemolysis and macrocytosis (110-­150 fL), with a low MCHC (24–30%), elevated erythrocyte sodium concentration, reduced potas- sium concentration, increased total Na+ and K+ content, and increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility. There are large numbers (10–30%) of sto- matocytes on peripheral blood smear. Patients typically develop jaun- dice, splenomegaly, and cholelithiasis. Treatment is supportive. RBC transfusions are occasionally required. Patients should be followed for evidence of hematologic decompensation during acute illness. Interval ultrasonography to detect cholelithiasis should be obtained. When there is significant hemolysis, folate should be prescribed daily. Similar to hereditary xerocytosis, significant postsplenectomy major thromboses have been observed; thus splenectomy is not recommended in hereditary hydrocytosis. INTERMEDIATE SYNDROMES AND OTHER VARIANTS Hereditary xerocytosis and hereditary hydrocytosis are at the extremes of disorders with alterations in erythrocyte permeability. Patients with intermediate defects have been described with vary- ing degrees of hemolysis and anemia. One of these intermediate syndromes is cryohydrocytosis in which affected patients typically suffer from mild anemia associated with stomatocytes, spherocytes, and sphero-­stomatocytes on peripheral blood smear. Cryohydro- cytosis erythrocytes are deficient in band 3 and demonstrate a sig- nificant cation leak upon cooling to low temperature (kyros = cold). This disorder is due to missense variants in band 3 that likely con- vert band 3 from an anion exchanger to a nonselective cation leak channel. Rh deficiency syndrome, also known as Rhnull syndrome, is mild to moderate hemolytic anemia associated with markedly decreased (Rhmod) or absent (Rhnull) Rh antigens on the erythrocyte membrane. Rhnull erythrocytes, which lack all Rh antigens, LW, and Fy5 antigens and have decreased reduced expression of Ss, U, and Duclos antigens, are dehydrated with decreased cell cation and water content. Findings on blood smear include reticulocytes, stomatocytes, and spherocytes. In response to immunization during pregnancy or after blood trans- fusion, Rhnull patients produce antibodies varying in specificity from reacting to anti-­e or anti-­C to reacting with all erythrocytes tested, an antibody called “anti-­total Rh.” Familial deficiency of high-­density lipoproteins (Tangier disease) is a rare recessive disorder that results from pathogenic variants in the cholesterol and phospholipid transport protein ABCA1, which lead to perturbations of cellular cholesterol transport and result in the accu- mulation of cholesterol esters in many tissues. Hematologic manifesta- tions include a mild to moderate stomatocytic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Affected patients can also have large orange tonsils, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, cloudy corneas, peripheral neuropathy, and premature atherosclerosis. Sitosterolemia, also known as phytosterolemia, is a recessive dis- order in which the absorption of sterols, both cholesterol and its plant-­derived relatives (e.g., sitosterol), is unlimited and unselec- tive. Clinical manifestations include early-­onset xanthomatosis, short stature, and premature coronary artery disease. Hematologic abnor- malities include macrothrombocytopenia and stomatocytic hemo- lytic anemia. The plasma cholesterol may or may not be abnormal, but mass spectrometry always shows a massive increase in plant sterol lev- els in the plasma and in the membranes of platelets and erythrocytes. Pathogenic variants in ABCG5 or ABCG8, transporters that actively pump plant sterols out of intestinal cells back into the intestine and out of liver cells into bile ducts, lead to gastrointestinal hyperabsorp- tion and decreased biliary elimination of plant sterols, as well as altered cholesterol metabolism. Treatment involves dietary restriction of cholesterol and plant sterols and prescription of ezetimibe, a sterol absorption inhibitor, and cholestyramine and other related bile acid– sequestering agents. OTHER DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH STOMATOCYTOSIS Acquired stomatocytosis may be seen with liver disease, alcohol- ism, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease and after vinca alkaloid administration. Stomatocytes can be seen as a blood smear–processing artifact. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. A B Fig. 509.1  Peripheral blood smears.

The underlying somatic pathogenic variant propagates into a clonal popu- lation of stem cells so that all blood cells derived from these variant clonal progenitors, especially red blood cells (RBCs), are susceptible to complement-­mediated destruction (Fig. 510.1). The pathogenic variant causes cell membranes to be deficient (either partially or com- pletely) in proteins that impede complement-­mediated lysis via the constitutively active alternative pathway. These complement regulat- ing proteins include decay-­accelerating factor (CD55), the membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD59), and the C8 binding protein. The underlying defect involves the glycolipid anchor that maintains these protective proteins on the cell surface. Various pathogenic variants in the PIGA gene that encodes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor protein have been identified in patients with PNH. Clinical Manifestations PNH is a rare disorder in children. Approximately 60% of pedi- atric patients have marrow failure, and the remainder have either intermittent or chronic anemia, often with prominent intravascular hemolysis (Tables 510.1 and 510.2). Nocturnal and morning hemo- globinuria is the classic finding in adults, but only a minority of PNH patients experience this. Most patients experience chronic hemoly- sis, often with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Hemoglobinuria is rarely seen in children compared with adults with PNH. Thrombosis and thromboembolic phenomena are serious complications that may be related to altered glycoproteins on the platelet surface and resul- tant platelet activation and production of procoagulant micropar- ticles. Abdominal venous thrombosis presents as recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, Budd-­Chiari syndrome (hepatic veins), or spleno- megaly (splenic vein). Released free hemoglobin results in depletion of nitric oxide, fostering vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and pain. Back and head pain may also be prominent. Hypoplastic or aplastic pancy- topenia can precede or follow the diagnosis of PNH; rarely, PNH may progress to acute myelogenous leukemia. At the time of presentation, more than 90% of patients with PNH have some blood abnormality (including ∼35% with anemia alone, ∼15% with anemia and thrombo- cytopenia, ∼7% with anemia and neutropenia, and ∼30% with pancy- topenia), >10% have abdominal pain, and >5% have thrombosis. The mortality in PNH is related primarily to the development of aplastic anemia or thrombotic complications. The predicted survival rate for children before the development of eculizumab was 80% at 5 years, 60% at 10 years, and 28% at 20 years. Laboratory Findings Hemoglobin levels can range from normal to markedly decreased. Common findings reflect chronic intravascular hemolysis and include hemosiderinuria, an elevated reticulocyte percentage, a low serum haptoglobin, and increased lactic dehydrogenase. Initially, the anemia is normocytic, but if iron deficiency develops, it becomes microcytic. On the blood smear, poikilocytosis and anisocytosis may be present. Markedly reduced levels of RBC acetylcholinesterase activity and decay-­accelerating factor are also found. Flow cytometry is the diagnostic test of choice for PNH. With the use of anti-­CD59 for RBCs and anti-­CD55 and anti-­CD59 for granulocytes, flow cytome- try is more sensitive than the classic RBC lysis (Ham or sucrose) tests in detecting these reduced glycolipid-­bound membrane proteins. Fluorescently labeled aerolysin testing can heighten the sensitivity of detection by binding selectively to glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. Treatment Eculizumab therapy has resulted in sustained survival in the major- ity of patients. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody against comple- ment component C5 that interrupts formation of the membrane attack complex, blocking downstream complement destruction of RBCs and activation of platelets. It decreases the rate of hemolysis, stabi- lizes hemoglobin levels, reduces the number of transfusions, reduces the risk of thrombosis, and improves quality of life. Eculizumab is an approved and effective treatment for PNH in adults. A recent phase I/ II trial demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients 11-­17 years of age. Because of the cost and duration of treatment (i.e., lifelong) required, particularly in children, it may be most useful in preventing thrombo- sis, anemia, and other symptoms while stem cell transplant is consid- ered. Survival in adults with PNH treated with eculizumab may not be different from sex-­ and age-­matched control patients from the general population. However, the medication does not improve the hemato- poietic clonal expansion or prevent marrow failure. Before begin- ning eculizumab, it is recommended to immunize patients with the meningococcal vaccine if the patient hasn’t already received this vac- cine because a very serious risk of complement inhibition is increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections. If eculizumab therapy is desired to begin immediately for clinical reasons, the vaccine can be given at the same time, and prophylactic antibiotics can be given for a 2-­week bridge. Headache is a common adverse effect after the first few doses but disappears subsequently. A poor response to eculizumab may be due to polymorphisms in the C5 gene that produce resistance to Chapter 510 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria and Acanthocytosis Stephanie Prozora and Patrick G.

Patients on eculizumab therapy require regular monitoring, including complete blood counts with reticulocytes, lac- tate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, and repeat flow cytometry every 6-­12 months. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a key therapeu- tic consideration if a suitable donor exists, particularly in children. Severe aplastic anemia is a strong indication for transplant in PNH (Fig. 510.2). HSCT is the only potentially curative therapy available for PNH. Nonmyeloablative transplantation (with reduced intensity con- ditioning regimens) are often used to reduce transplant-­related mor- tality and morbidity; because eradication of only the PNH clones is sought, total myeloablation is not necessary. Glucocorticoids such as prednisone can be used for acute hemolytic episodes; the dosage should be tapered as soon as the hemolysis abates. Prolonged anticoagulation (heparin or low molecular weight heparin) therapy may be of benefit when thromboses occur. Because of chronic urinary loss of iron as hemosiderin, iron therapy may be necessary. Androgens (e.g., fluoxymesterone), antithymocyte globulin, cyclospo- rine, and growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-­ stimulating factor) have been used to treat marrow failure. ACANTHOCYTOSIS Acanthocytosis is characterized by RBCs with irregular circumferen- tial pointed projections (also known as spur cells) (see Fig. 507.4E).

In liver disease, acanthocytes develop because of increased abundance of free cholesterol, as patients develop splenic congestion, hemolytic anemia, and jaundice. Abetalipoproteinemia is an inherited autosomal recessive disease in which acanthocytosis is associated with fat malabsorption, progressive ataxia, and retinitis pig- mentosa. The fat malabsorption may become apparent in the first year of life, whereas the ataxia develops at school-­age. The anemia is usu- ally mild. Hypobetalipoproteinemia is a recessive familial disease that has a similar clinical spectrum, but with milder findings. Aceruloplas- minemia leads to anemia, diabetes, ocular problems, tremors, chorea, ataxia, and facial abnormalities due to increased iron in the brain and other organs. There are four genetically diverse neuroacanthocytosis syndromes (Table 510.3).

In contrast to acanthocytes, echinocytes or “burr cells” have a more regular distribution of projections or serrations along the surface of the RBCs and will tend to a more spheroidal cell contour as they age. They are seen often as artifacts (e.g., due to elevated pH, contact with glass, or blood storage) and infrequently in end-­stage renal disease, liver dis- ease, uremia, pyruvate-­kinase deficiency, long-­distance runners, and patients with hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia.

Abnormalities in these proteins are referred to as hemoglobinopathies. More than 800 variant hemoglobins have been described. The most common and useful clinical classification of hemoglobinopathies is based on nomenclature associated with alteration of the involved glo- bin chain. Two hemoglobin (Hb) gene clusters are involved in Hb pro- duction and are located at the end of the short arms of chromosomes 16 and 11. Their control is complex, including an upstream locus con- trol region on each respective chromosome and an X-­linked control site. On chromosome 16, there are three genes within the alpha (α) gene cluster: zeta (ζ), alpha 1 (α1), and alpha 2 (α2). On chromosome 11, there are five genes within the beta (β) gene cluster: epsilon (ε), gamma 1 (γ1), gamma 2 (γ2), delta (δ), and beta (β). The order of gene expression within each cluster roughly follows the order of expression during the embryonic period, fetal period, and eventually childhood. After 8 weeks of fetal life, the embryonic hemoglobins, Gower-­1 (ζ2ε2), Gower-­2 (α2ε2), and Portland (ζ2γ2), are formed. At 9 weeks of fetal life, the major hemoglobin is hemoglobin F (HbF; α2γ2). Hemoglobin A (HbA; α2β2) first appears at approximately 1 month of fetal life but does not become the dominant hemoglobin until after birth, when HbF levels start to decline. HbA2 (α2δ2) is a minor hemoglobin that appears shortly before birth and remains at a low level after birth. The final hemoglobin distribution pattern that occurs in childhood is not achieved until at least 6 months of age and sometimes later. The normal hemoglobin pattern is ≥95% HbA, ≤3.5% HbA2, and <2.5% HbF. 511.1  Sickle Cell Disease Kim Smith-­Whitley and Janet L.

Medical care provided by a pediatric hematologist is also associated with a decreased frequency of emergency department (ED) visits and length of hospitalization com- pared to patients who were not seen by a hematologist within the last year. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Hemoglobin S (HbS) is the result of a single base-­pair change, thymine for adenine, at the 6th codon of the β-­globin gene. This change encodes valine instead of glutamine in the sixth residue in the β-­globin mol- ecule. Sickle cell anemia (HbSS), homozygous HbSS, occurs when both β-­globin alleles have the sickle cell pathogenic variant (βs). Sickle cell disease refers not only to patients with sickle cell anemia but also to compound heterozygotes where one β-­globin allele includes the sickle cell pathogenic variant and the second β-­globin allele includes a gene pathogenic variant other than the sickle cell pathogenic variant, such as HbC, β-­thalassemia, HbD, and HbOArab. In sickle cell anemia, HbS is typically as high as 90% of the total hemoglobin, whereas in sickle cell disease, HbS is >50% of all hemoglobin. In red blood cells (RBCs), the hemoglobin molecule has a highly specified conformation allowing for the transport of oxygen in the body. In the absence of globin-­chain pathogenic variants, hemoglo- bin molecules do not interact with one another. However, the pres- ence of HbS results in a conformational change in the Hb tetramer, and in the deoxygenated state, HbS molecules interact with each other, forming rigid polymers that give the RBC its characteristic “sickled” shape. Intraerythrocytic changes lead to a shortened RBC life span and hemolysis. Hemolysis leads to multiple changes, including altered nitric oxide metabolism and oxidant stress, which contribute to endo- thelial dysfunction. Intravascular sickling primarily occurs in the post- capillary venules and is a function of both mechanical obstruction by sickled erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes and increased adhesion between these elements and the vascular endothelium. Sickle cell dis- ease is also an inflammatory disease based on nonspecific markers of inflammation, including, but not limited to, elevated baseline white blood cell (WBC) count and cytokines. DIAGNOSIS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY Every state in the United States has instituted a mandatory newborn screening program for sickle cell disease. Such programs identify new- borns with the disease and provide prompt diagnosis and referral to providers with expertise in sickle cell disease for anticipatory guidance and the initiation of penicillin prophylaxis before 4 months of age. The most commonly used procedures for newborn diagnosis include thin-­layer/isoelectric focusing (IEF) and high-­performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Some laboratories perform genetic testing on specimens demonstrating abnormal hemoglobins. A confir- matory step is recommended, with all patients who have initial abnor- mal screens being retested during the first clinical visit, which helps to account for potential administrative errors in specimen handling. In addition, a complete blood cell count (CBC) and Hb phenotype deter- mination is recommended for both parents to provide an opportunity for genetic counseling and to better characterize disease genotype in the affected offspring if necessary. Infants who may have HbS-­hereditary persistence fetal hemoglobin (HbSHPFH) but do not have full paren- tal studies should have molecular testing for β-­globin genotype before 12 months of age (or sooner if hydroxyurea is initiated). Table 511.1 correlates the initial hemoglobin phenotype at birth with the type of hemoglobinopathy. In newborn screening programs, the hemoglobin with the great- est quantity is reported first, followed by other hemoglobins in order of decreasing quantity. Some states perform IEF initially on newborn blood samples, then use DNA probes to confirm abnormal hemoglo- bins found on IEF. In newborns with a hemoglobin analysis result of HbFS, the pattern supports HbSS, HbSHPFH, or HbSβ0-­thalassemia. In certain situations, a newborn with a hemoglobin analysis of HbFS may have HbSβ+-­thalassemia and the hemoglobin A may not be dem- onstrating on the electrophoresis in quantities high enough for detec- tion. In a newborn with a hemoglobin analysis of FSA, the pattern is supportive of the diagnosis of HbSβ+-­thalassemia. The diagnosis of HbSβ+-­thalassemia is confirmed if at least 50% of the hemoglobin is HbS, HbA is present, and the amount of HbA2 is elevated (typically >3.5%), although HbA2 is not elevated in the newborn period. In new- borns with a hemoglobin analysis of FSC, the pattern supports a diag- nosis of HbSC. In newborns with a hemoglobin analysis of FAS, the pattern supports a diagnosis of HbAS (sickle cell trait); however, in this circumstance, care must be taken to confirm that the newborn has not received an RBC transfusion before testing. A newborn with a hemoglobin analysis of AFS either has been trans- fused with RBCs before collection of the newborn screen to account for the greater amount of HbA than HbF, or there has been an error. The patient may have either sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait and Table 511.1     Various Newborn Sickle Cell Disease Screening Results with Baseline Hemoglobin NEWBORN SCREENING RESULTS: SICKLE CELL DISEASE* POSSIBLE HEMOGLOBIN PHENOTYPE† BASELINE HEMOGLOBIN RANGE AFTER AGE 5 YR FS SCD-­SS 6-­11 g/dL SCD-­S β0 thal 6-­10 g/dL SCD-­S β+ thal 9-­12 g/dL SCD-­S δβ− thal 10-­12 g/dL S HPFH 12-­14 g/dL FSC SCD-­SC 10-­15 g/dL FSA‡ SCD-­S β+ thal 9-­12 g/dL FS other SCD-­S β0 thal 6-­10 g/dL SCD-­SD, SOArab, SCHarlem, SLepore Variable AFS‡§ SCD-­SS 6-­10 g/dL SCD-­S β+ thal 6-­9 g/dL SCD-­S β0 thal 7-­13 g/dL variable *Hemoglobins are reported in order of quantity. †Requires confirmatory hemoglobin analysis after at least 6 mo of age and, if possible, β-­globin gene testing or hemoglobin analysis from both parents for accurate diagnosis of hemoglobin phenotype. ‡Sickle cell trait is another possible diagnosis. §Impossible to determine the diagnosis because the infant most likely received a blood transfusion before testing.

Given the implications of a diagnosis of sickle cell disease versus sickle cell trait in a newborn, the importance of repeating the Hb identification analysis in the patient and obtaining a Hb identification analysis and CBC to evaluate the peripheral blood smear and RBC parameters in the parents cannot be overemphasized. Unintended mis- takes do occur in state newborn screening programs. Newborns who have the initial phenotype of HbFS but whose final true phenotype is HbSβ+-­thalassemia have been described as one of the more common errors identified in newborn screening hemoglobinopathy programs. Determining an accurate phenotype is important for appropriate genetic counseling for the parents. In addition, distinguishing HbSS from HbSHPFH in the newborn period usually requires parental or genetic testing. Infants who maintain HbF percentages above 25% after 12 months of age without evidence of hemolysis should have testing for β-­globin gene deletions consistent with HPFH. These children have a much milder clinical course and do not require penicillin prophylaxis or hydroxyurea therapy. If the parents are tested for sickle cell trait or hemoglobinopathy trait, full disclosure to the parent tested should be provided privately, and in some circumstances, the issue of paternity may be disclosed. For this reason and because of healthcare privacy, common practice is to always seek permission for the genetic testing and to report the hemo- globinopathy trait results back to each parent separately. In the United States, sickle cell disease is the most common genetic disorder identified through the state-­mandated newborn screening program, occurring in 1:2,647 births. The sickle hemoglobin gene is more prevalent in communities of color because descendants of people where malaria has been endemic are more likely to have been protected from the severe manifestations of malaria. Regarding ethnicity in the United States, sickle cell disease occurs in Black persons at a rate of 1:396 births and in Hispanics at a rate of 1:36,000 births. In the United States, an estimated 100,000 people have sickle cell disease, with an eth- nic distribution of 90% Black and 10% Hispanic. The U.S. sickle cell disease population represents a fraction of the worldwide burden of the disease, with global estimates of 312,000 neonates born annually with HbSS disease. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND TREATMENT OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA For a comprehensive discussion of the clinical management of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, refer to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 2014 Expert Panel Report on the Evidence-­Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease (https://www.nhlb i.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-­cell-­disease-­report.pdf). Fever and Bacteremia Fever in a child with sickle cell anemia is a medical emergency, requir- ing prompt medical evaluation and delivery of antibiotics because of the increased risk of serious bacterial infection and subsequent high mortality rate. As early as 6 months of age, infants with sickle cell anemia develop abnormal immune function because of splenic dys- function. By 5 years of age, most children with sickle cell anemia have complete functional asplenia. Regardless of age, all patients with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk of infection and death from bacterial infection, particularly encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningiti- dis, as well as Salmonella spp. Several clinical strategies have been developed to manage children with sickle cell disease who present with fever. These strategies range from hospital admission for intravenous (IV) antimicrobial therapy to administering a third-­generation cephalosporin in an ED or outpatient setting to patients without established risk factors for occult bactere- mia (Table 511.2). Given the observation that the average time for a positive blood culture is <20 hours in children with sickle cell anemia, admission for 24 hours is probably the most prudent strategy for chil- dren and families who live out of town or who are identified as high risk for poor follow-­up. Outpatient management of fever without a source should be consid- ered in children with the lowest risk of bacteremia and after appropriate cultures are obtained and IV ceftriaxone or another cephalosporin is given. Observation after antibiotic administration is important because children treated with ceftriaxone can develop severe, rapid, and life-­ threatening immune hemolysis. In the event that Salmonella spp. or Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia occurs, strong consideration should be given to an evaluation for osteomyelitis with an MRI, given the increased risk of osteomyelitis in children with sickle cell anemia com- pared to the general population. Screening laboratory and radiologic studies are strongly recommended to identify those at risk for transient red cell aplasia, acute splenic sequestration, and acute chest syndrome (ACS), because many children with these diagnoses present to acute care settings with isolated fever. Screening children and caregivers for psychosocial factors that could impede their return to the hospital in the case of a positive blood culture is essential. Aplastic Crisis Human parvovirus B19 infection poses a unique threat for patients with sickle cell disease because this infection results in temporary red cell aplasia, limiting the production of reticulocytes and causing pro- found anemia (see Fig. 507.3 in Chapter 507). Any child with sickle cell disease, fever, and reticulocytopenia should be presumed to have parvovirus B19 infection until proven otherwise. However, reticulo- cytopenia is not a requirement for the diagnosis of a recent parvo- virus B19 infection because reticulocytosis and increased nucleated RBCs may be seen in the recovery phase. Diagnostic testing for the presence of human parvovirus B19 with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is superior to using immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG titers. The acute exacerbation of anemia is treated conservatively using red cell transfusion when the patient becomes hemodynami- cally symptomatic or has a concurrent illness, such as ACS or acute splenic sequestration. Children with suspected aplastic crisis should be closely monitored because acute infection with parvovirus B19 is associated with pain, splenic sequestration, ACS, glomerulonephritis, arthropathy, and stroke. Patients with parvovirus-­associated aplastic crisis are contagious, and infection precautions should be taken to avoid nosocomial spread of the infection and to avoid exposure of pregnant caregivers who may be at risk for adverse fetal outcomes with acute infection. Splenic Sequestration Acute splenic sequestration is a life-­threatening complication occur- ring primarily in infants and young children with sickle cell anemia.

Chapter 511  u  Hemoglobinopathies  2969 The incidence of splenic sequestration has declined from an estimated 30% to 12.6% with early identification by newborn screening and improved parental education. Sequestration can occur as early as 5 weeks of age but most often occurs in children between ages 6 months and 2 years. Patients with the SC and Sβ+-­thalassemia types of sickle cell disease can have acute splenic sequestration events throughout adolescence and adulthood. Splenic sequestration is associated with rapid spleen enlargement causing left-­sided abdominal pain and Hb decline from the patient’s baseline. Sequestration may lead to signs of hypovolemia as a result of the trapping of blood in the spleen and profound anemia, with total Hb falling below 3 g/dL. A decrease in WBC and platelet count may also be present. Sequestration may be spontaneous or triggered by fever, bacteremia, or viral infections. Treatment includes early intervention and maintenance of hemody- namic stability using isotonic fluid or transfusions. Careful blood trans- fusions with RBCs are recommended to treat both the sequestration and the resultant anemia. Blood transfusion aborts the RBC trapping in the spleen and allows release of the patient’s blood cells that have become sequestered, often raising Hb above baseline values. A reason- able approach is to provide only 5 mL/kg of RBCs and/or a posttransfu- sion Hb target of 8 g/dL, keeping in mind that the goal of transfusion is to prevent hypovolemia. Blood transfusion that results in Hb levels >10 g/dL may put the patient at risk for hyperviscosity syndrome because RBCs may be released from the spleen after transfusion. Repeated episodes of splenic sequestration are common, occurring in 65% of patients. Most recurrent episodes develop within 6 months of the previous episode. Prophylactic splenectomy performed after an acute episode has resolved is the only effective strategy for pre- venting future life-­threatening episodes. Although blood transfusion therapy has been used with the goal of preventing subsequent epi- sodes, evidence strongly suggests that this strategy does not reduce the risk of recurrent splenic sequestration compared to no transfu- sion therapy. However, a short course of regular RBC transfusions can be used until splenectomy is arranged. Children should be appro- priately immunized with meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines before surgery. Penicillin prophylaxis should be prescribed after splenectomy. Hepatic and Gallbladder Involvement See Chapters 408 and 414. Sickle Cell Pain Dactylitis, referred to as hand-­foot syndrome, is often the first manifestation of pain in infants and young children with sickle cell anemia, occurring in 50% of children by their second year of life (Fig. 511.1). Dactylitis often manifests with symmetric or less often unilateral swelling of the hands and/or feet. Unilateral dacty- litis can be confused with osteomyelitis, and careful evaluation to distinguish the two is important because treatment differs signifi- cantly. Dactylitis requires palliation with pain medications, whereas osteomyelitis requires at least 4-­6 weeks of IV antibiotics. Feedback from the parents is needed to determine if pain therapy is successful in relieving pain. The cardinal clinical feature of sickle cell disease is acute vasooc- clusive pain. Acute sickle cell pain is characterized as unremitting discomfort that can occur in any part of the body but most often occurs in the chest, abdomen, or extremities. These painful episodes are often abrupt and cause disruption of daily life activities and sig- nificant stress for children and their caregivers. A patient with sickle cell anemia has approximately one painful episode per year that requires medical attention, but the frequency is extremely variable. The pattern of symptoms with subsequent episodes may resemble that of previous episodes. The exact etiology of pain is unknown, but the pathogenesis may be initiated when blood flow is disrupted in the microvasculature by sickled RBCs and other cellular elements, resulting in tissue ischemia. Acute sickle cell pain may be precipitated by physical stress, infection, dehydration, hypoxia, local or systemic acidosis, exposure to cold, and swimming for prolonged periods. However, most pain episodes occur without an identifiable trigger. Successful treatment of these episodes requires education of both caregivers and patients regarding the recog- nition of symptoms and the optimal management strategy. Given the absence of any reliable objective laboratory or clinical parameter asso- ciated with pain, trust between the patient and the treating physician is paramount to successful clinical management. Specific therapy for pain varies greatly but generally includes the use of acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) early in the course of pain, followed by escalation to a combination analgesic regimen using a single-­agent short-­acting oral opioid, long-­acting oral opioid, and continued nonopioid agent. The majority of painful episodes in patients with sickle cell dis- ease are managed at home with comfort measures, such as heating pad, relaxation techniques, massage, and oral pain medication. Some patients require treatment in an acute care setting with IV morphine or derivatives of morphine. The primary goal of treatment in these set- tings is timely administration of analgesics to provide relief of pain. The incremental increase and decrease in the use of the medication to relieve pain roughly parallels the eight phases associated with a chronology of pain and comfort in children (Table 511.3). When pain requires continued parenteral analgesic administration, hospitaliza- tion or prolonged stays in day hospitals are required. The average hospital length of stay for children admitted in pain is 4.4 days. The American Society of Hematology and NHLBI clinical guidelines for treating acute and chronic pain in children and adults with sickle cell disease are comprehensive and represent a starting point for treating pain. The only measure for degree of pain is the patient. Healthcare pro- viders working with children in pain should use a consistent, validated pain scale (e.g., Wong-­Baker FACES Scale) for assessing pain. Although pain scales have proved useful for some children, other forms of pain assessment may be required to determine when opioid therapy should be initiated and decreased. Individualized pain plans provide impor- tant information for assessment and treatment that address patient preferences. Several myths have been propagated regarding the treatment of pain in sickle cell disease. The concept that all painful episodes in children should be managed without opioids is without foundation and results in unwarranted suffering on the part of the patient. Blood transfusion therapy during an existing painful episode does not decrease the inten- sity or duration of the painful episode.

Opioid depen- dency in children with sickle cell disease is rare and should never be used as a reason to withhold pain medication. However, patients with mul- tiple painful episodes requiring hospitalization within 1 year or with pain episodes that require hospitalization for >7 days should be evalu- ated for comorbidities and environmental stressors that are contribut- ing to the frequency or duration of pain. Children with chronic pain should be evaluated for other disease-­related complications, including, but not limited to, presence of avascular necrosis, leg ulcers, and ver- tebral body compression fractures. A careful history is warranted to distinguish chronic pain that often is not relieved by opioids versus recurrent acute prolonged vasoocclusive pain episodes. Skeletal pain (bone or bone marrow infarction) with or without fever must be differentiated from osteomyelitis. Both Salmonella spp. and S. aureus cause osteomyelitis in children with sickle cell disease, often involving the diaphysis of long bones (in contrast to children without sickle cell anemia, in whom osteomyelitis is in the metaphyseal region of the bone). Differentiating osteomyelitis from a vasoocclusive crisis is often difficult. Clinical signs and symptoms can be consistent with both osteomyelitis and vasoocclusive crises because low-­grade fever pain, swelling of the affected area, high WBC counts, and elevated C-­reactive protein levels can be present in both. Blood, fluid, and tissue cultures, when positive, are helpful. MRI may be useful for locating an area to obtain fluid for culture. Ultimately, aspiration with or with or without biopsy and culture will be needed to differentiate the two processes (see Chapter 725). Avascular Necrosis Avascular necrosis (AVN) occurs at a higher rate among children with sickle cell disease than in the general population and is a source of both acute and chronic pain. Most often, the femoral head is affected. AVN of the hip may cause limp and leg-­length discrepancy. Other sites affected include the humeral head and mandible. Risk factors for AVN include HbSS disease with α-­thalassemia trait, frequent vasoocclusive episodes, and elevated hematocrit (for patients with sickle cell ane- mia). Optimal treatment of AVN has not been determined, and indi- vidual management requires consultation with a sickle cell specialist, orthopedic surgeon, physical therapist, and primary care physician. Initial management should include referral to a pediatric orthope- dist and a physical therapist to address strategies to increase strength and decrease weight-­bearing daily activities that may exacerbate the pain associated with AVN as well as to determine whether surgical approaches may be beneficial. Opioids are often used but usually can be tapered after the acute pain has subsided. Regular blood transfusion therapy has not been demonstrated as an effective therapy to abate the acute and chronic pain associated with AVN. Priapism Priapism, defined as an unwanted painful erection of the penis, affects males of all sickle genotypes but most frequently affects males with sickle cell anemia. The mean age of first episode is 15 years, although priapism has been reported in children as young as 3 years. The actu- arial probability of a patient experiencing priapism is approximately 90% by 20 years of age. Priapism occurs in two patterns: prolonged, lasting >4 hours, or stut- tering, with brief episodes that resolve spontaneously but may occur in clusters and herald a prolonged event. Both types occur from early childhood to adulthood. Most episodes occur between 3 am and 9 am. Priapism in sickle cell disease represents a low-­flow state caused by venous stasis from RBC sickling in the corpora cavernosa. Recurrent prolonged episodes of priapism are associated with erectile dysfunc- tion (impotence). The optimal treatment for acute priapism is unknown. Supportive therapy, such as a hot shower, short aerobic exercise, or pain medication, is often used by patients at home. A prolonged episode lasting >4 hours should be treated by aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa, fol- lowed by irrigation with dilute epinephrine to produce immediate and sustained detumescence. Urology consultation is required to initiate this procedure, with appropriate input from a hematologist. Simple blood transfusion with exchange transfusion has been proposed for the acute treatment of priapism, but limited evidence supports this strategy as the initial management. If no benefit is obtained from surgical management, transfusion therapy should be considered. However, detumescence may not occur for up to 24 hours (much longer than with urologic aspira- tion) after transfusion, and transfusion for priapism has been associ- ated with acute neurologic events. Consultation with a hematologist and urologist will help identify therapies to prevent recurrences.

Before the development of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to screen for stroke risk among children with sickle cell anemia, approximately 11% experienced an overt stroke before age 20. A functional defini- tion of overt stroke is the presence of a focal neurologic deficit lasting for >24 hours and/or abnormal neuroimaging of the brain indicat- ing a cerebral infarct on T2-­weighted MRI corresponding to the focal neurologic deficit (Figs. 511.2 and 511.3). A silent cerebral infarct lacks focal neurologic findings and is diagnosed by abnormal imaging on T2-­weighted MRI. The prevalence of silent infarct among children with HbSS is around 35%. Children with other types of sickle cell disease, such as HbSC or HbSβ+-­thalassemia, develop overt or silent cerebral infarcts as well, but at a lower frequency than children with HbSS and HbSβ0-­thalassemia. Other neurologic complications include transient ischemic attacks, headaches that may or may not correlate to degree of anemia, seizures, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral vasculopathy, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Chiari I malformations can occur in older children with sickle cell disease. Fat embolism syndrome (associated with bone marrow infarction) is a rapidly progressive, potentially fatal complication involving pain, respiratory distress, changes in mental status, and multiorgan system failure. When this syndrome is identified early, exchange transfusion therapy has improved patient survival in small case series. Skull infarc- tion can lead to a subgaleal hematoma or epidural bleed, which may present as altered mental status. For patients presenting with acute focal neurologic deficit, a prompt pediatric neurologic evaluation and consultation with a pediatric hematologist is recommended. In addition, oxygen administration to keep oxygen saturation (So2) >96% and blood transfusion within 2 hours of presentation, with a goal of increasing Hb to a maximum of 10 g/dL, is warranted. A timely simple blood transfusion is impor- tant because this is the most efficient strategy to dramatically increase oxygen content of the blood, particularly when exchange transfusion is not readily available. However, greatly exceeding this posttransfu- sion Hb limits oxygen delivery to the brain as a result of hyperviscos- ity by increasing the Hb significantly over the patient’s baseline values. Subsequently, prompt treatment with an exchange transfusion is rec- ommended, either manually or with automated erythrocytapheresis, to reduce the HbS percentage to <30%. Exchange transfusion at the time of acute stroke is associated with a decreased risk of second stroke compared to simple transfusion alone. CT of the head to exclude cerebral hemorrhage should be performed as soon as possible, and, if available, MRI of the brain with diffusion-­weighted imaging to distin- guish between ischemic infarcts and PRES. MR venography is useful to evaluate the possibility of cerebral venous thrombosis, a rare but potential cause of focal neurologic deficit in children with sickle cell disease. MR angiography may identify evidence of cerebral vasculopa- thy; these images are not critical in the initial time management of a child with sickle cell disease presenting with a focal neurologic deficit but are important for long-­term management. The clinical presentation of PRES or central venous thrombosis can mimic a stroke but would require a different treatment course. For both PRES and cerebral venous thrombosis, the optimal management has not been defined in patients with sickle cell disease, resulting in the need for consultation with both a pediatric neurologist and a pediatric hematologist. The primary approach for prevention of recurrent overt stroke is blood transfusion therapy aimed at keeping the maximum HbS concentration <30%. Despite regular blood transfusion therapy, approximately 20% of patients will have a second stroke and 30% of this group will have a third. Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography Primary prevention of overt stroke can be accomplished using screen- ing transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) assessment of the blood velocity in the terminal portion of the internal carotid and the proximal portion of the middle cerebral artery. Children with sickle cell anemia with an elevated time-­averaged mean maximum (TAMM) blood flow velocity ≥200 cm/sec (abnormal study) are at increased risk for a cerebrovascular event. A repeat study should be performed within a week to confirm the result. However, a single value ≥220 cm/ sec is concerning and does not require repeating before recommend- ing an intervention. A TAMM measurement of <200 but ≥170 cm/sec represents a conditional threshold. A repeat measurement is suggested within a few months because of the high rate of conversion to a TCD velocity >200 cm/sec in this group of patients. Two distinct methods of measuring TCD velocity are a nonimag- ing technique and an imaging technique. The nonimaging technique was the method used in the stroke prevention trial sponsored by the A B Fig. 511.2  MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain. A, T2-­weighted MRI shows remote infarction of the territories of the left anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery.

When compared to each other, the imaging technique produces values that are 10–15% below those of the nonimaging technique. The imaging technique uses the time-­averaged mean of the maximum velocity (TAMX), and this measure is believed to be equivalent to the nonimaging calculation of TAMM. A down- ward adjustment for the transfusion threshold is appropriate for cen- ters using the imaging method to assess TCD velocity. The magnitude of the transfusion threshold in the imaging technique has not been settled, but a transfusion threshold of a TAMX of 185 cm/sec and a conditional threshold of TAMX of 165 cm/sec seem reasonable. Alter- natively, some experts recommend using the same thresholds regard- less of technique. Children with abnormal TCD studies should begin chronic blood transfusion therapy to maintain HbS levels <30% to decrease the risk of first stroke. This strategy results in an over 90% reduction in the rate of overt strokes. Once transfusion therapy is initiated, a subset of patients at low risk for the development of increased TCD values, such as those without MRA-­confirmed cerebral vasculopathy, may be able to transition from chronic transfusions to long-­term hydroxyurea ther- apy. Acute stroke risk is decreased when hydroxyurea use and chronic transfusions overlap until a robust therapeutic response to hydroxy- urea is achieved. Pulmonary Complications Lung disease in children with sickle cell disease is the second most com- mon reason for hospital admission and is associated with significant mortality. ACS refers to a life-­threatening pulmonary complication of sickle cell disease defined as a new radiodensity on chest radiography. Other clinical definitions include clinical features such as fever, respi- ratory distress, hypoxia, cough, and chest pain (Fig. 511.4). Even in the absence of respiratory symptoms, very young children with fever should receive a chest radiograph to identify evolving ACS because clinical examination alone is insufficient to identify patients with a new radiographic density. Early detection of ACS may alter clinical manage- ment. The radiographic findings in ACS are variable but may include single-­lobe involvement, predominantly left lower lobe; multiple lobes, most often both lower lobes; and pleural effusions, either unilateral or bilateral. ACS may progress rapidly from a simple infiltrate to extensive infiltrates and a pleural effusion. Therefore continuous pulse oximetry and frequent clinical exams are required, and repeat chest x-­ray films may be indicated for progressive hypoxia, dyspnea, tachypnea, and other signs of respiratory distress. Most patients with ACS do not have a single identifiable cause. Infec- tion is the most well-­known etiology, yet only 30% of ACS episodes will have positive sputum or bronchoalveolar culture, and the most com- mon bacterial pathogens are S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia spp. The most frequent event preceding ACS is a pain- ful episode requiring systemic opioid treatment. Fat emboli have also been implicated as a cause of ACS, arising from infarcted bone marrow, and can be life-­threatening if large amounts are released to the lungs. Fat emboli can be difficult to diagnose but should be considered in any patient with sickle cell disease presenting with rapid onset of respira- tory distress and altered mental status changes. Petechial rash may also occur but may be difficult to detect if not carefully sought. Given that the causes of ACS are varied, recommended manage- ment is also multimodal (Table 511.4).

However, under no cir- cumstance should opioid administration be limited to prevent ACS; rather, other measures must be taken to prevent ACS from developing. In patients with pain, regular use of an incentive spirometer at 10-­12 breaths every 2 hours can significantly reduce the frequency of subse- quent ACS episodes. Because of the clinical overlap between pneumo- nia and ACS, all episodes should be treated promptly with antimicrobial therapy, including at least a macrolide and a third-­generation cephalo- sporin. A previous diagnosis of asthma or wheezing with ACS should prompt treatment following standard of care for an asthma exacerba- tion with bronchodilators. The diagnosis of ACS does not negate the recommended management of a patient with asthma exacerbation. Oxygen should be administered for patients who demonstrate hypoxia. Blood transfusion therapy using either simple or exchange (manual or automated) transfusion is the only method to abort a rapidly progress- ing ACS episode. The decision when to give blood and whether the transfusion should be a simple or exchange transfusion is less clearly defined. Usually, blood transfusions are given when at least one of the following clinical features are present: decreasing So2, increasing work of breathing, rapidly changing respiratory effort either with or with- out a worsening chest radiograph, a dropping Hb of 2 g/dL below the patient’s baseline, or previous history of severe ACS requiring admis- sion to the intensive care unit. Pulmonary hypertension has been identified as a major long time risk factor for death in adults with sickle cell anemia. The natural his- tory of pulmonary hypertension in children with sickle cell anemia is unknown. Asymptomatic patients do not require screening for pul- monary hypertension. The initial diagnostic test is an echocardiogram and, depending on the severity of those findings, the echocardiogram should be followed by right-­sided heart catheterization. Clinical find- ings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension include hypoxia or dyspnea at rest or with exertion, comorbid vascular complications (leg ulcers, priapism), elevated N-­terminal, pro-­B-­type natriuretic peptide, or an abnormal 6-­minute walk distance. Renal Disease and Enuresis Renal disease among patients with sickle cell disease is a major comor- bid condition that can lead to premature death. Seven sickle cell disease nephropathies have been identified: gross hematuria, papillary necro- sis, nephrotic syndrome, renal infarction, hyposthenuria, pyelonephri- tis, and renal medullary carcinoma. The presentation of these entities is varied but may include hematuria, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, concentrating defects, or hypertension. The common presence of nocturnal enuresis occurring in chil- dren with sickle cell disease is not well defined but is troublesome for affected children and their parents. The overall prevalence of enuresis was 33% in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, with the highest prevalence (42%) among children 6-­8 years old. Furthermore, enuresis may still occur in approximately 9% of older adolescents. Patients with sickle cell disease and nocturnal enure- sis should have a systematic evaluation for recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney function, and possibly obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Unfortunately, most children with nocturnal enuresis do not have an etiology, and targeted therapeutic interventions have been of limited success. Cognitive and Psychologic Complications Ongoing evaluation of the family unit and identification of the resources available to cope with a chronic illness are critical for opti- mal management. Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease have decreased quality of life, as measured on standardized assess- ments, compared to their siblings and children with other chronic diseases. Furthermore, children with sickle cell disease are at great risk for academic failure and have a 20% high school graduation rate, possibly because, among other reasons, approximately one third of children with sickle cell anemia have had a cerebral infarct, either silent or an overt stroke. Early school-­age children with sickle cell anemia should have MRI without sedation to screen for silent cerebral ischemia. Children with cerebral infarcts require ongoing cognitive and school performance assessment so that education resources can be focused to optimize educational attainment. Participation in rel- evant support groups and group activities, such as camps for children with sickle cell disease, may be of direct benefit by improving self-­ esteem and establishing peer relationships. Other Complications In addition to the previous organ dysfunctions, patients with sickle cell disease can have other significant complications. These complications include, but are not limited to, sickle cell retinopathy, delayed onset of puberty, leg ulcers, and complications associated with pregnancy. Opti- mal treatment for each of these entities has not been determined, and individual management requires consultation with the hematologist and primary care physician. Reproductive health issues are prevalent in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease; therefore hema- tologists, adolescent medicine teams, and obstetrics/gynecology teams should co-­manage patients to provide optimal care. THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS Hydroxyurea Hydroxyurea is a well-­established drug proven effective in reducing the frequency of acute pain episodes. In adults with sickle cell anemia, hydroxyurea decreases the rate of hospitalization for painful episodes by 50% and the rate of ACS and blood transfusion by almost 50%. In addition, adults taking hydroxyurea have shorter hospitalizations and require less analgesic medication during hospitalization. In children with sickle cell anemia, hydroxyurea is safe and well tolerated. The primary toxicities are limited to myelosuppression that reverses on cessation of the drug. Infants treated with hydroxyurea experience fewer episodes of pain, dactylitis, and ACS; are hospital- ized less frequently; and less often require a blood transfusion. Infants treated with hydroxyurea do not experience increased rates of bactere- mia or serious infection. Current recommendations are that all children with sickle cell anemia should be offered hydroxyurea beginning at 9 months of age. Hydroxy- urea may be indicated for other sickle cell–related complications, especially in patients who are unable to tolerate other treatments. For patients who either will not or cannot continue blood transfusion ther- apy to prevent recurrent stroke, hydroxyurea therapy may be a reason- able alternative. The trial assessing the efficacy of hydroxyurea as an alternative to transfusions to prevent a second stroke was terminated early after the data safety and monitoring process found an increased stroke rate in the hydroxyurea arm compared to the transfusion arm. Hydroxyurea alone is inferior to transfusion therapy for secondary stroke prevention in patients who do not have contraindications to ongoing transfusions. The long-­term toxicity associated with initiating hydroxyurea in very young children has not yet been established. However, all evidence to date suggests that the benefits far outweigh the risks. For these reasons, very young children starting hydroxyurea require well-­informed parents and medical care by pediatric hematologists, or at least co-­management by a physician with expertise in immunosuppressive medications. The typical starting dose of hydroxyurea is 15-­20 mg/kg once daily, with an incremental dosage increase every 8 weeks of 5 mg/kg, and if no toxici- ties occur, up to a maximum of 35 mg/kg per day. The infant hydroxy- urea study found young children could safely be started at 20 mg/kg/ day without increased toxicity. Achievement of the therapeutic effect of hydroxyurea can require several months, and for this reason, initiating hydroxyurea to address short-­term symptom relief is not optimal. We prefer to introduce the concept to parents within the first year of life, pref- erably by 9 months; provide literature that describes both the pros and cons of starting hydroxyurea in children with severe symptoms of sickle cell disease; and educate parents on starting hydroxyurea in asymptom- atic children as a preventive therapy for repetitive pain and ACS events. Other effects of hydroxyurea that may vary include an increase in the total Hb level and a decrease in the TCD velocity. Other medications are available for long-­term use in children and adults with sickle cell disease.

Chapter 511  u  Hemoglobinopathies  2975 monthly IV, is indicated for reducing acute pain in adults and children age 16 years and older. Voxelotor, a sickle hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor, is FDA-­approved for adults and children 4 years and older. In clinical trials, Voxelotor demonstrated reduced hemolysis in patients with sickle cell disease. Gene Therapy The FDA (2023) has approved two different gene therapy approaches to ex vivo gene modification of autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells following myeloablative conditioning. Both therapies are approved for patients ≥12 years of age with recurrent vasoocclusive crises. Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel: exa-cel), involves gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats / CRISPR associated nuclease 9). Exa-cel specifically targets and inactivates the red cell precursor BCL11A gene (a suppressor of fetal hemoglobin expression), which results in increased production of fetal hemoglobin (which does not sickle), resulting in decreased polymerization of sickle hemoglobin. Lyfgenia (lovotibeglogene autotemcel: lovo-cel) is a gene addition approach using a lentiviral vector carrying a modified beta globin gene (beta-A-T87Q globin), thus increasing the levels of hemoglobin A. Both have been successful in reducing or eliminating vasoocclusive crises after therapy. Lyfgenia has a black box warning for the risk of off target editing /insertional mutagenesis and the possibility of acute myeloid leukemia. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation The only currently approved cure for sickle cell anemia is transplan- tation with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched hematopoietic stem cells from a sibling donor (allogenic) without sickle cell dis- ease. Because of the limited availability of appropriate sibling donors, research is exploring a wide variety of curative regimens. Clinical trials are underway to explore unrelated and partially matched related donor stem cell transplants. The most common indications for allogenic transplant are recur- rent ACS, stroke, and abnormal TCD. Sibling-­matched stem cell trans- plantation has a lower risk for graft-­versus-­host disease than unrelated donors. Surveys suggest that younger children may have lower morbid- ity and mortality. The decision to consider unrelated transplantation should involve appropriate consultation and counseling from physi- cians with expertise in sickle cell transplantation. Stem cell transplantation for children with sickle cell disease who have a genetically matched sibling and few complications is less com- monly performed. The use of hydroxyurea has dramatically decreased the disease burden for the patient and family, with far fewer hospital- izations for pain or ACS episodes and less use of blood transfusions. The field of stem cell transplantation is also progressing such that larger studies involving nonsibling donor and haploidentical donor trans- plantation. Transplant-­related complications caused by conditioning regimens may be decreased by using low-­intensity, nonmyeloablative HLA-­matched sibling, allogenic stem cell transplantation. Red Blood Cell Transfusions RBC transfusions are used frequently both in the treatment of acute complications and to prevent acute or recurrent complications. Typi- cally, short-­term transfusions are used to prevent progression of acute complications such as ACS, aplastic crisis, splenic sequestration, and acute stroke, as well as to prevent surgery-­related ACS. RBC transfu- sions are not recommended for uncomplicated acute pain events. Select RBC volumes judiciously to avoid high posttransfusion Hb levels and hyperviscosity. Long-­term or chronic transfusion therapy is used to prevent first stroke in patients with abnormal TCD or MRI findings (silent stroke), recurrent stroke, or recurrent ACS. Patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk of developing alloantibodies to less common RBC surface antigens after receiving even a single transfu- sion. In addition to standard cross matching for major blood group antigens (A, B, O, RhD), more extended matching should be performed to identify donor units that are C-­, E-­, and Kell-­antigen matched. Full RBC antigen phenotyping or genotyping for all patients with sickle cell disease should be performed before RBC transfusion whenever pos- sible to have the RBC units least likely to result in alloimmunization available for these patients. Three methods of blood transfusion therapy are used in the man- agement of acute and chronic complications associated with sickle cell disease: automated erythrocytapheresis, manual exchange transfu- sion (phlebotomy of a set amount of patient’s blood followed by rapid administration of donated packed RBCs), and simple transfusion. The decision on which method to use depends on the patient’s pretransfu- sion Hb level, the clinical indication, RBC alloimmunization, and trans- fusional iron overload. Exchange transfusion, manual or automated, is preferable for patients with new neurologic symptoms. Automated erythrocytapheresis is the preferred method for patients requiring chronic blood transfusion therapy because there is a minimum net iron balance after the procedure, followed by manual exchange transfusion. However, this method requires technical expertise, special machines, and good patient venous access. Manual exchange is more accessible. However, both methods may expose the patient to more RBC units and possible alloimmunization. Simple transfusion therapy may lower donor exposure and be more readily available but may result in higher net iron burden when compared to erythrocytapheresis or exchange transfusion. Preparation for surgery for children with sickle cell disease requires a coordinated effort from the hematologist, surgeon, anesthesiologist, and primary care provider. Historically, ACS was associated with general anesthesia in patients with sickle cell disease. Blood transfusion before surgery for children with sickle cell disease is recommended to raise Hb level preoperatively to no more than 10 g/dL, to avoid ACS development. Because of better general perioperative care and the use of long-­term therapies such as hydroxyurea and chronic transfusions, the decision to transfuse before general anesthesia should be made in conjunction with the medical team who provides sickle cell disease–related care for the patient. When preparing a child with sickle cell disease for surgery with a simple blood transfusion, caution must be used not to elevate Hb level beyond 10 g/dL because of the risk of hyperviscosity syndrome. For children with milder forms of sickle cell disease, such as HbSC or HbSβ-­thalassemia, a decision must be made on a case-­by-­case basis as to whether an exchange transfusion is warranted because a simple transfu- sion may raise the hemoglobin to an unacceptable level. Iron Overload The primary toxic effect of blood transfusion therapy relates to exces- sive iron stores or iron overload, which can result in organ damage and premature death. Excessive iron stores develop after 100 mL/kg of RBC transfusion, or about 10 transfusions. The assessment of iron overload in children receiving regular blood transfusions is difficult. The most common and least invasive method of estimating total body iron involves serum ferritin levels. Ferritin measurements have significant limitations in their ability to estimate iron stores for several reasons, including, but not limited to, elevation during acute inflammation and poor correla- tion with excessive iron in specific organs, such as the heart and endo- crine glands. MRI of the liver has proved to the most effective approach for assessment of iron stores. MRI T2* and MRI R2 and R2* sequences are used to estimate iron levels in the heart and liver. These imaging strategies are more accurate than serum ferritin in estimating heart and liver iron content. The standard for iron assessment previously was liver biopsy, which is an invasive procedure exposing children to the risk of general anesthesia, bleeding, and pain. Liver biopsy alone does not accurately estimate total body iron because iron deposition in the liver is not homogeneous and does not always correlate with iron levels in the heart and other organs. The major advantage of a liver biopsy is that histologic assessment of the parenchyma can be ascertained along with appropriate staging of suspected pathology, particularly cirrhosis. The primary treatment of transfusion-­related iron overload requires iron chelation using medical therapy. In the United States, three chelating agents are approved for use in transfusional iron overload. Deferoxamine is administered subcutaneously 5 of 7 nights/week over 8 to 12 hours a night. Deferasirox is taken by mouth daily, and deferiprone is available in tablet forms taken orally twice or three times a day and an oral solution taken three times a day. The FDA approved deferasirox for use in patients Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

A pill formulation of deferasirox is available that does not require mixing before oral administration. A sprinkle formulation that is mixed with a soft food such as applesauce also is available for young children who are unable to swallow pills. Deferiprone is an older oral che- lator that has been widely used outside the United States for many years and was also approved as a first-­line agent (see Table 511.8). Because of a 1–2% risk of agranulocytosis, weekly CBC monitoring is recommended, particularly in the first 6 months of treatment and with any febrile ill- ness. Transfusion-­related excessive iron stores in children with sickle cell disease should be managed by a physician with expertise in chelation therapy because of the need for close monitoring and due to the risk of significant toxicity from available chelation therapies. OTHER SICKLE CELL SYNDROMES The most common sickle cell syndromes besides HbSS are HbSC, HbSβ0-­ thalassemia, and HbSβ+-­thalassemia. The other syndromes—HbSD, HbSOArab, HbSHPFH, HbSE, and other variants—are much less com- mon. Patients with HbSβ0-­thalassemia have a clinical phenotype similar to those with HbSS. In the RBCs of patients with HbSC, crystals of HbC interact with membrane ion transport, dehydrating RBCs and induc- ing sickling. Children who have HbSC disease can experience the same symptoms and complications as those with severe HbSS disease, but less frequently. Children with HbSC have increased incidence of retinopa- thy, chronic hypersplenism, and acute splenic sequestration over the life span. The natural history of the other sickle cell syndromes is variable and difficult to predict because of the lack of systematic evaluation. There is no validated model that can predict the clinical course of an individual with sickle cell disease. A patient with HbSC can have a more severe clinical course than a patient with HbSS. Management of end-­organ dysfunction in children with sickle cell syndromes requires the same general principles as managing patients with sickle cell ane- mia; however, each situation should be managed on a case-­by-­case basis and requires consultation with a pediatric hematologist. ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE Children with sickle cell disease should receive general health main- tenance as recommended for all children, with special attention to disease-­specific guidance and infection prevention education. In addi- tion to counseling regarding adherence to penicillin and a vaccination schedule, patients, parents, and caregivers should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention for all febrile illness. In addition, early detection of acute splenic sequestration has been shown to decrease mortality. Therefore parents and caregivers should be educated early and repeatedly about the importance of daily penicillin administration and correct palpation of the spleen. Prophylactic Penicillin Children with sickle cell anemia should receive prophylactic oral peni- cillin VK until at least 5 years of age (125 mg twice daily up to age 3 years, then 250 mg twice daily thereafter). No established guidelines exist for penicillin prophylaxis beyond 5 years of age; some clinicians continue penicillin prophylaxis, and others recommend discontinua- tion. Penicillin prophylaxis should be continued beyond 5 years in chil- dren with a history of pneumococcal infection because of the increased risk of a recurrent infection. An alternative for children who are aller- gic to penicillin is erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Immunizations In addition to penicillin prophylaxis, routine childhood immuniza- tions, as well as the annual administration of influenza vaccine, are highly recommended. Children with sickle cell disease develop func- tional asplenia and also require immunizations to protect against encapsulated organisms, including additional pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccinations. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides vaccination guidelines at https://www.cdc. gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-­recs/index.html. Spleen Palpation Splenomegaly is a common complication of sickle cell disease, and splenic sequestration can be life threatening. Parents and primary caregivers should be taught how to palpate the spleen to determine if the spleen is enlarging starting at the first visit, with reinforcement at subsequent visits. Parents should also demonstrate spleen palpation to the provider. Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound Primary stroke prevention using TCD has resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of overt stroke among children with sickle cell anemia. Children with HbSS or HbSβ0-­thalassemia should be screened annually with TCD starting at age 2 years. TCD is best performed when the child is quietly awake and in their usual state of health. TCD measurements may be falsely elevated or decreased in the settings of acute anemia, sedation, pain, fever, or immediately after blood transfusions. Screening should occur annually from ages 2-­16 years. Abnormal values should be repeated within a week to identify patients at greatest risk of overt stroke. Conditional values should be repeated within at least 3 months, and normal values should be repeated annually. Routine neuroimaging with MRI in asymptomatic patients requires consultation with a pedi- atric hematologist or neurologist with expertise in sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea Recommendations include offering hydroxyurea therapy to all children with sickle cell anemia starting at 9 months of age regardless of clinical symptoms. Monitoring children receiving hydroxyurea is labor intensive. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapeutic agent, and patients receiving this agent require the same level of nursing and physician oversight as any child with cancer receiving chemotherapy. The parents must be educated about the consequences of therapy, and when ill, children should be promptly evaluated. Starting doses should be approximately 20 mg/kg/day. CBC with differential and reticulocyte count should be checked within 4 weeks after initiation of therapy or any dose change to monitor for hematologic toxicity, then every 8-­12 weeks. Dose escalation should be based on clini- cal and laboratory parameters. If appropriate, dose increases should be in 5 mg/kg/day increments to a maximum of 35 mg/kg/day. While receiving hydroxyurea, steady-­state absolute neutrophil count should be approximately 2,000/μL or higher and platelet count should be 80,000/μL or higher. However, children may tolerate lower abso- lute neutrophil counts while receiving hydroxyurea. Holding hydroxy- urea and adjusting to lower doses may be required for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Hydroxyurea is a pregnancy class D medica- tion, and adolescents should be counseled regarding methods to pre- vent pregnancy while taking this medication. Close monitoring of the patient requires a commitment by the parents and the patient as well as diligence by a physician to identify toxicity early. Information is scarce regarding the impact of hydroxyurea on fertility, although hydroxyurea has been shown to further reduce sperm count in males with sickle cell disease in several case reports; this effect may be reversible once hydroxyurea is discontinued. Red Cell Transfusion Therapy At the initiation of blood transfusion therapy, children with sickle cell disease should have testing to identify the presence of alloantibodies and RBC phenotyping or genotyping, which is performed to identify the best matched blood. RBC units selected should be extended antigen-­ matched for C, E, and K, when feasible. Goals of transfusion for acute events should be established before initiating therapy, including target posttransfusion Hb level and HbS percentage, or both. For children receiving chronic transfusion therapy, pretransfusion HbS goals should be defined; the most common goal is <30%. Posttransfusion Hb values should be targeted to avoid hyperviscosity. Children, parents, and care- givers should be educated about the symptoms of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. Any child with sickle cell disease with a recent his- tory of RBC transfusion who presents with pain, dark urine, increased scleral icterus, or symptoms of worsening anemia should be screened for a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction after consultation with the blood bank. Children meeting criteria for chronic transfusion therapy should receive annual evaluation for transfusion-­transmitted infections, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. After receiving 100 mL/kg RBC transfusions, regular assessments of iron overload should begin, usually including measurements of serum ferritin and MRI assessments for hepatic iron every 1-­2 years.

Chapter 511  u  Hemoglobinopathies  2977 performed in children over 10 years old, especially if there is a history of poor adherence with iron chelation and/or liver iron concentration of 15 mg/g dry weight or higher. For children requiring chelation therapy, audiology and ophthalmology exams should be performed annually and monitoring of liver function and pituitary function performed regularly because of iron deposition. Pulmonary and Asthma Screening Pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease are common and life threatening. Asthma is common in children with sickle cell disease, and thus evaluation for asthma symptoms and asthma risk factors should be performed routinely, particularly given the high morbidity and mortality. All children should receive annual screening for signs and symptoms of lower airway disease, such as nighttime cough and exercise-­induced cough. In children with symptoms consistent with lower airway disease, consultation with an asthma specialist should be considered. Pulse oximetry readings should be performed during well visits to identify children with abnormally low daytime oxygen satura- tion. For children with snoring, daytime somnolence, and symptoms associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), sleep stud- ies should be performed as necessary. Retinopathy Effective therapy is available for retinopathy associated with sickle cell disease. Although all patients are at risk for development of retinopa- thy, those with sickle cell disease, type SC, are at very high risk. Patients should receive annual screening by an ophthalmologist to identify vas- cular changes that would benefit from laser therapy. Although changes may occur earlier, children with sickle cell disease should begin annual screenings no later than age 10 years. Renal Disease Sickle cell–associated renal disease starts in infancy and may not become clinically evident until adulthood. Chronic kidney disease is common in adults with sickle cell disease, with high morbidity and mortality. Screen- ing protocols for early signs of sickle nephropathy in children have not been adopted due to lack of data. However, when creatinine elevation, microalbuminuria, or macroalbuminuria is detected, a nephrologist should be consulted to determine next steps for further evaluation and possible treatment. The age to begin screening for proteinuria has not been defined, but some experts recommend screening annually after at least 10 years, if not sooner. If proteinuria is detected, urine stud- ies should be repeated with an early-­morning urine collection; if the protein remains elevated, the patient should be referred to a pediatric nephrologist. Males with sickle cell disease should also receive counsel- ing regarding the diagnosis and treatment of priapism. Because of the high frequency of enuresis beyond early childhood, approximately 9% between 18 and 20 years of age, parents and caregivers should be edu- cated about the prolonged nature of enuresis in this disease. OSAS is associated with an increased prevalence of enuresis in sickle cell disease. Unfortunately, no evidence-­based therapies have been developed to treat enuresis in children and young adults with sickle cell disease. In children with enuresis who have symptoms and clinical features of OSAS, referral to specialists for evaluation is recommended. Echocardiography Echocardiography is a screening tool to identify individuals with sickle cell disease who have pulmonary artery hypertension (see the section on “Pulmonary Hypertension”). Studies in adults with sickle cell dis- ease have found that echocardiography is insensitive at identifying indi- viduals truly at risk for pulmonary hypertension, although an elevated tricuspid velocity measurement may still be a risk factor for premature death in adults with sickle cell disease. Routine echocardiograms for pulmonary hypertension screening are not recommended in asymp- tomatic children; however, they are recommended in patients with leg ulcers, priapism, and connective tissue disease, as well as referral to a pulmonary hypertension specialist for patients with new steady-­state cardiorespiratory symptoms, heart failure, or pulmonary embolus. Additional Screening Patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for behavioral health issues, including anxiety and depression. Screening should be performed at routine and acute visits. AVN of the hips and shoulders is increased in patients with sickle cell disease and may be identified early on routine physical exam. Plain radiographs may not detect early disease; thus, when AVN is suspected and plain films are normal, MRI should be obtained. When AVN is confirmed, patients should be referred promptly to orthopedics and physical therapy.

Kwiatkowski The prevalence of sickle cell trait varies throughout the world; in the United States, the incidence is 7–10% of the Black population. Because all state newborn screening programs include sickle cell disease, for most children, sickle cell trait is first identified on their newborn screen. Communication of sickle cell trait status from infancy to young adulthood for the affected individual, family, and healthcare providers is often inconsistent, and many young adults are unaware of their sickle cell trait status. By definition, among individuals with sickle cell trait, the HbS level is <50%. The life span of people with sickle cell trait is normal, and serious complications are extremely rare. The CBC is within the nor- mal range (Fig. 511.5B). Hemoglobin analysis is diagnostic, revealing a predominance of HbA, typically >50%, and HbS <50%. Rare com- plications of sickle cell trait may exist. Sickle cell trait is reported to be associated with exertional rhabdomyolysis in military recruits, and possibly with sudden death during rigorous exercise. However, whether these reports establish sickle cell trait as a risk factor that is nonmodifiable by other genetic factors remains unclear. Other com- plications reported with sickle cell trait include splenic infarction at high altitude, hematuria, hyposthenuria, deep vein thrombosis, and susceptibility to progressive eye injury after hyphema (Table 511.5). Renal medullary carcinoma has been reported almost exclusively in individuals with sickle cell trait and occurs predominantly in young people. Children with sickle cell trait do not require limitations on physi- cal activities as long as provisions are made for frequent rest and oral hydration, particularly when participating in physical conditioning or competitive sports. Sudden death in persons with sickle cell trait while exercising under extreme conditions is most likely associated with a second genetic factor and/or environmental factors and not the presence of sickle cell trait itself. However, if exertional rhab- domyolysis is identified, evaluation by neurology and cardiology should be considered. No causal pathway has been implicated for the presence of sickle cell trait and sudden death. All patients with sickle cell trait who participate in rigorous athletic activities should receive maximum hydration and appropriate rest during exertion, as would be the precautionary steps for all athletes, particularly when par- ticipating in hot, humid conditions. The presence of sickle cell trait should never be a reason to exclude a person from athletic participa- tion but rather should serve as an indication that prudent surveil- lance is necessary to ensure appropriate hydration and prevention of exhaustion from heat or other strenuous exercise. If athletes are to be screened for sickle cell trait, the appropriate procedure is test- ing using a hemoglobin electrophoresis followed by genetic counsel- ing, along with the knowledge that genetic information may provide opportunities to challenge paternity. Such situations are typically handled by a pediatrician or hematologist accustomed to providing both a balanced approach to genetic counseling and addressing the challenges about paternity.

Kwiatkowski HEMOGLOBIN C The pathogenic variant for HbC is at the same site as in HbS, with sub- stitution of lysine instead of valine for glutamine. In the United States, hemoglobin C trait (HbAC) occurs in 1:40 and homozygous hemoglo- bin C disease (HbCC) occurs in 1:5,000 of the Black population. HbAC is asymptomatic. HbCC can result in mild anemia, splenomegaly, and cholelithiasis; rare cases of spontaneous splenic rupture have been reported. Splenic dysfunction does not occur. This condition is usually diagnosed through newborn screening programs. HbC crystallizes, disrupting the red cell membrane, and HbC crystals may be visible on peripheral smear (see Fig. 511.5C). HEMOGLOBIN E Hemoglobin E is an abnormal hemoglobin resulting from a qualita- tive pathogenic variant in the β-­globin gene and is the second most common globin pathogenic variant worldwide. Patients may have asymptomatic hemoglobin E trait (HbAE) or benign homozygous hemoglobin E disease (HbEE). Compound heterozygous hemoglobin E/β-­thalassemia produces clinical phenotypes ranging from moder- ate to severe anemia, depending on the β-­thalassemia pathogenic variant. In California, HbE/β-­thalassemia is found almost exclusively in persons of Southeast Asian descent, with a prevalence of 1:2,600 births. HEMOGLOBIN D At least 16 variants of hemoglobin exist. HbD-­Punjab (Los Angeles) is a rare hemoglobin that is seen in 1–3% of Western Indians and in some Europeans with Asian-­Indian ancestry and produces symptoms of sickle cell disease when present in combination with HbS. Hetero- zygous HbD or hemoglobin D trait (HbAD) is clinically silent. Homo- zygous hemoglobin D disease (HbDD) produces a mild to moderate anemia with splenomegaly. 511.4  Unstable Hemoglobin Disorders Kim Smith-­Whitley and Janet L. Kwiatkowski At least 200 rare unstable hemoglobins have been identified; the most common is Hb Köln. Most patients seem to have de novo patho- genic variants rather than inherited hemoglobin disorders. The best-­ studied unstable hemoglobins are the ones leading to hemoglobin denaturation from pathogenic variants affecting heme binding. The denatured hemoglobin can be visualized during severe hemolysis or after splenectomy as Heinz bodies. Unlike the Heinz bodies seen after toxic exposure, in unstable hemoglobins, Heinz bodies are pres- ent in reticulocytes and older RBCs (see Fig. 511.5D). Heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Children with homozygous gene pathogenic variants can present in early childhood with anemia and splenomegaly or with unexplained hemolytic anemia. Hemolysis is increased with febrile illness and with the ingestion of oxidant medications (similar to glucose-­6-­phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency [see Chapter 512.3]) with some unstable hemoglobins. If the spleen is functional, the blood smear can appear almost normal or have only hypochromasia and basophilic stip- pling. A diagnosis may be made by demonstrating Heinz bodies, Hb instability, or an abnormal Hb analysis (although some unstable hemo- globins have normal mobility and are not detected on Hb analysis).

Oxidative drugs should be avoided, and folate supplementation may be helpful if dietary deficiency is a concern. Splenectomy may be considered in patients requiring recur- rent transfusion or demonstrating poor growth, but the complications of splenectomy, including bacterial sepsis, risk of thrombosis, and risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, should be considered before surgery. 511.5  Abnormal Hemoglobins with Increased Oxygen Affinity Kim Smith-­Whitley and Janet L. Kwiatkowski More than 110 high-­affinity hemoglobins have been characterized. These pathogenic variants affect the state of Hb configuration dur- ing oxygenation and deoxygenation. Hemoglobin changes struc- ture when in the oxygenated versus the deoxygenated state. The deoxygenated state is termed the T (tense) state and is stabilized by 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate. When fully oxygenated, hemoglobin assumes the R (relaxed) state. The exact molecular interactions between these two states are unknown. High-­affinity hemoglobins contain patho- genic variants that either stabilize the R form or destabilize the T form. The interactions between the R and T forms are complex, and the mechanisms of the pathogenic variants are not known. In most cases, the high-­affinity hemoglobins can be identified by Hb analysis; approximately 20% must be characterized under controlled conditions where measurements are obtained with the P50 lowered to 9-­21 mm Hg (normal: 23-­29 mm Hg). The decreased P50 in these hemoglobins leads to an erythrocytosis with Hb levels of 17-­20 g/dL. Levels of erythropoi- etin and 2,3-­DPG are normal. Patients are usually asymptomatic and do not need phlebotomy. If phlebotomy is performed, oxygen delivery could be problematic because of the reduced number of Hb molecules to carry oxygen. 511.6  Abnormal Hemoglobins Causing Cyanosis Kim Smith-­Whitley Abnormal hemoglobins causing cyanosis, also called structural met- hemoglobinemias, are rare. They are referred to as M hemoglobins and represent a group of hemoglobin variants that result from point pathogenic variants in one of the globin chains, α, β, or γ, located in the heme pocket; 13 known variants exist. These unstable hemoglo- bins lead to hemolytic anemia, most pronounced when the β-­globin gene is affected. Clinically, these children are cyanotic from birth, without other signs or symptoms of disease, if the pathogenic vari- ant is in the α-­globin gene (HbM Boston, HbM Iwate, Hb Auckland). Infants with β-­globin pathogenic variants become cyanotic later in infancy after the fetal hemoglobin switch (HbM Saskatoon, HbM Chile, HbM Milwaukee 1 and 2). The γ-­chain pathogenic variants (HbF-­M Fort Ripley, HbF-­M Osaka, HbF Cincinnati, HbF Circleville, HbF Toms River, HbF Viseu) are all transient, presenting with cya- nosis at birth, which resolves during the neonatal period after HbF production discontinues. The abnormal M hemoglobins exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance and are diagnosed by Hb analysis. HbM variants may not be isolated reli- ably using Hb analysis (HPLC or IEF); consequently, diagnostic confir- mation may require DNA sequencing or mass spectrometry. There is no specific treatment and affected patients do not respond to treatments used for enzyme-­deficient methemoglobinemia. Beyond cyanosis, individuals are otherwise asymptomatic and do not require additional monitoring. Children with the β-­globin form should avoid oxidant drugs. Individuals with all forms have a normal life expectancy and pregnancy course. Low-­affinity hemoglobins have less cyanosis than the M hemoglo- bins. The amino acid substitutions destabilize the oxyhemoglobin and lead to decreased oxygen saturation. The best characterized are Hb Kansas, Hb Beth Israel, and Hb Denver. Hb analysis (IEF and HPLC techniques) may be normal in affected individuals. When clinically suspected, oxygen affinity studies reveal a right-­shifted dissociation curve, and heat testing demonstrates unstable hemoglobin. Children present with mild cyanosis only. 511.7  Hereditary Methemoglobinemia Kim Smith-­Whitley and Janet L. Kwiatkowski Hereditary methemoglobinemia is a clinical syndrome caused by an increase in the serum concentration of methemoglobin either because of congenital changes in hemoglobin synthesis or of metabo- lism leading to imbalances in reduction and oxidation of hemoglo- bin. The iron molecule in hemoglobin is normally in the ferrous state (Fe2+), which is essential for oxygen transport. Under physiologic conditions, there is a slow, constant loss of electrons to released oxygen, and the ferric (Fe3+) form combines with water, producing methemoglobin (MetHb). The newly formed MetHb has a reduced ability to bind oxygen. Two pathways for MetHb reduction exist. The physiologic and pre- dominant pathway is a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinu- cleotide (NADH)–dependent reaction catalyzed by cytochrome b5 reductase. This mechanism is >100-­fold more efficient than the pro- duction of MetHb. The alternate pathway uses NAD phosphate gen- erated by G6PD in the hexose monophosphate shunt and requires an extrinsic electron acceptor to be activated (i.e., methylene blue, ascor- bic acid, riboflavin). In normal individuals, oxidation of hemoglobin to MetHb occurs at a slow rate, 0.5–3%, which is countered by MetHb reduction to maintain a steady state of 1% MetHb. MetHb may be increased in the RBC because of exposure to toxic substances or to absence of reductive pathways, such as NADH-­ cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency. Toxic methemoglobinemia is much more common than hereditary methemoglobinemia (Table 511.6). Infants are exceptionally vulnerable to hemoglobin oxidation because their erythrocytes have half the amount of cytochrome b5 reductase seen in adults, hemoglobin F is more susceptible to oxida- tion than hemoglobin A, and the more alkaline infant gastrointestinal (GI) tract promotes the growth of nitrite-­producing gram-­negative bacteria. When MetHb levels are >1.5 g/24 hours, cyanosis is visible (15% MetHb); a level of 70% MetHb is lethal. The MetHb level is usu- ally reported as a percentage of normal hemoglobin, and the toxic level is lower at a lower Hb level. Methemoglobinemia has been described in infants who ingested foods and water high in nitrates, who were exposed to aniline teething gels or other chemicals, and in some infants with severe gastroenteritis and acidosis. Methemoglobin can color the blood brown (Fig. 511.6). A patient with significant methemoglo- binemia is cyanotic and does not respond to 100% oxygen. Arterial oxygen tension will be normal or elevated (if on high FiO2) despite cyanosis, but blood oxygen saturation determined by multiwavelength co-­oximetry will be low. Oxygen saturation calculated from arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry is misleading and inaccurate. Although pulse oximetry is usually lower than normal, it does not reflect the true degree of desaturation. 511.8  Hereditary Methemoglobinemia with Deficiency of NADH Cytochrome b5 Reductase Kim Smith-­Whitley The first reported inherited disorder causing methemoglobinemia resulted from an enzymatic deficiency of NADH cytochrome b5 Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

All rights reserved. 2980  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood reductase, which was classified into two distinct phenotypes. In type I, the most common form, the deficiency of NADH cytochrome b5 activity is found only in erythrocytes, with other cell types unaffected. In type II, the enzyme deficiency is present in all tissues and results in more significant symptoms beginning in infancy with encephalopathy, intellectual impairment, spasticity, microcephaly, and growth retarda- tion, with death most often by 2 years of age. Both types exhibit an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Cyanosis varies in intensity with season and diet. The time of cyano- sis onset also varies, appearing in some patients at birth and others as late as adolescence. Although as much as 50% of the total circulating hemoglobin may be in the form of nonfunctional MetHb, little or no cardiorespiratory distress occurs in these patients, except on exertion. Daily oral treatment with ascorbic acid (200-­500 mg/day in divided doses) gradually reduces the MetHb to approximately 10% of the total pigment and alleviates the cyanosis as long as therapy is continued. Chronic high doses of ascorbic acid have been associated with hyper- oxaluria and renal stone formation. Ascorbic acid should not be used to treat acute toxic methemoglobinemia. When immediately available, poison control should be contacted to verify the most up-­to-­date ther- apeutic strategies. As with ascorbic acid, riboflavin uses the alternate pathway of MetHb reduction and is most effective when given in high doses. Methylene blue, administered via IV (1-­2 mg/kg initially), is used to treat toxic methemoglobinemia. An oral dose can be adminis- tered (100-­300 mg/day) as maintenance therapy. Methylene blue should not be used in patients with G6PD deficiency. This treatment is ineffective and can cause severe oxidative hemolysis. If methylene blue is given to a patient with G6PD deficiency, symptoms will not improve, and marked hemolysis can develop within 24 hours of administration. Because G6PD deficiency status is rarely known at the time of treatment, a careful history should be elicited. When the history is negative for symptoms of G6PD deficiency, treatment with methylene blue should be initiated judiciously, and the patient should be closely monitored for improvement. 511.9  Syndromes of Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin Kim Smith-­Whitley and Janet L. Kwiatkowski Hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) syndromes are a form of thal- assemia; pathogenic variants are associated with a decrease in the pro- duction of either or both β-­ and δ-­globins. There is an imbalance in the α:non-­α synthetic ratio characteristic of thalassemia. More than 20 variants of HPFH have been described. They are deletional, δβ0 (Black, Ghanaian, Italian), nondeletional (Tunisian, Japanese, Australian), linked to the β-­globin–gene cluster (British, Italian-­Chinese, Black), or unlinked to the β-­globin–gene cluster (Atlanta, Czech, Seattle). The δβ0 forms have deletions of the entire δ-­ and β-­globin gene sequences, and the most common form in the United States is the Black (HPFH 1) variant. As a result of the δ and β gene deletions, there is production only of γ-­globin and formation of HbF. In the homozygous form, no manifestations of thalassemia are present. There is only HbF with very mild anemia and slight microcytosis. When inherited with other variant hemoglobins, HbF is elevated into the 20–30% range; when inherited with HbS, sickle cell disease is ameliorated, with fewer complications.

Arterial whole blood with 1% methemoglobin (left) vs arterial whole blood with 72% methemoglobin (right). Note the characteristic chocolate-­brown color of the sample with an elevated methemoglobin level. Both sam- ples were briefly exposed to 100% oxygen and shaken. This quick anal- ysis is a good bedside test for methemoglobinemia. The sample on the left turned bright red, whereas the sample on the right remained chocolate-­brown. Methods: Whole blood samples were drawn at the same time from the same person. The measured hemoglobin concen- tration was 11.7 g/dL. Calculated concentration of methemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL × 0.01 = 0.117 g/dL (left) and 11.7 g/dL × 0.72 = 8.42 g/dL (right). An elevated methemoglobin level was made in vitro by adding 0.1 mL of a 0.144 molar solution of sodium nitrate (right), and 0.1 mL of normal saline was added as a control (left). Co-­oximetry measurements were taken on both samples shortly after the blood was drawn and 20 min after the addition of sodium nitrate solution. Both blood samples were exposed to 100% oxygen before the second measurement. (Pro- tocol based on personal communication with Dr. Ali Mansouri, Decem- ber 2002.)

Kwiatkowski Thalassemia refers to a group of genetic disorders of globin-­chain produc- tion in which there is an imbalance between the α-­globin and β-­globin chain production. β-­thalassemia syndromes result from a decrease in β-­ globin chains, which results in a relative excess of α-­globin chains. There are >300 β-­thalassemia pathogenic variants that have been characterized. These pathogenic variants can affect any step in the transcription of β-­ globin genes. β0-­thalassemia refers to the absence of production of the β-­globin. When patients are homozygous for the β0-­thalassemia gene, they cannot make any normal β-­globin chains (HbA). β+-­thalassemia indicates a pathogenic variant that makes decreased amounts of normal β-­globin (HbA). Some β-­thalassemia pathogenic variants have structural changes such as HbE. Others, such as δβ-­thalassemia or HPFH, are vari- ants of β-­thalassemia that have decreased production of β-­globin gene with increased compensatory production of HbF. β0-­thalassemia syndromes are generally more severe than β+-­thalassemia syndromes, but there is significant variability between the genotype and phenotype. β-­thalassemia major, commonly called transfusion-­dependent thalassemia, refers to severe β-­thalassemia that requires early transfusion therapy. β-­thalassemia intermedia (also known as non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia) is a clinical diagnosis of a patient with a less severe clinical phenotype that usually does not require regular transfusion therapy in childhood. Many of these patients have at least one β+-­thalassemia pathogenic variant. β-­ thalassemia syndromes usually require a β-­thalassemia pathogenic variant in both β-­globin genes. Carriers with a single β-­globin pathogenic variant are generally asymptomatic, except for microcytosis and mild anemia. In α-­thalassemia, there is an absence or reduction in α-­globin production usually due to deletions of α-­globin genes. Normal indi- viduals have four α-­globin genes; the more genes affected, the more severe the disease. α0-­thalassemia indicates no α-­chains produced from that chromosome (− −/). α+-­thalassemia produces a decreased amount of α-­globin chain from that chromosome (-­alpha/). The primary pathology in the thalassemia syndromes stems from the quantity of globin produced, whereas the primary pathology in sickle cell disease is related to the quality of β-­globin produced. EPIDEMIOLOGY There are >300 different pathogenic variants resulting in absent or decreased globin production. Although most are rare, the 20 most com- mon abnormal alleles constitute 80% of the known thalassemias world- wide; 1.5% of the world’s population carries alleles for β-­thalassemia, and in Southeast Asia 5–10% of the population carry alleles for α-­thalassemia. In the United States, an estimated 2,000 persons have β-­thalassemia major. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Two related features contribute to the sequelae of β-­thalassemia syn- dromes: inadequate β-­globin gene production leading to decreased levels of normal hemoglobin (HbA) and unbalanced α-­ and β-­globin chain production leading to ineffective erythropoiesis. In β-­thalassemia α-­globin chains are in excess to non–α-­globin chains, and α-­globin tetramers (α4) are formed and appear as RBC inclusions. The free α-­globin chains and inclusions are very unstable, precipitate in RBC precursors, damage the RBC membrane, and shorten RBC survival, leading to anemia and increased erythroid production (Table 511.7). This results in a marked increase in erythropoiesis, with early erythroid precursor death in the bone marrow. Clinically, this is characterized by a lack of maturation of erythrocytes and an inappropriately low reticu- locyte count. This ineffective erythropoiesis and the compensatory massive marrow expansion with erythroid hyperactivity characterize β-­thalassemia. Because of the low or absent production of β-­globin, the α-­chains combine with γ-­chains, resulting in HbF (α2γ2) being the dominant hemoglobin. In addition to the natural survival effect, the γ-­globin chains may be produced in increased amounts, regulated by genetic polymorphisms. The δ-­chain synthesis is not usually affected in β-­thalassemia or β-­thalassemia trait, and therefore patients have a relative or absolute increase in HbA2 production (α2δ2). In the α-­thalassemia syndromes, there is a reduction in α-­globin production. Normally, there are four α-­globin genes (two from each parent) that control α-­globin production. α-­thalassemia syndromes vary from complete absence (hydrops fetalis) to only slightly reduced (α-­thalassemia silent carrier) α-­globin production. In the α-­thalassemia syndromes, an excess of β-­ and γ-­globin chains are produced. These excess chains form hemoglobin Bart’s (γ4) in fetal life and HbH (β4) after birth. These abnormal tetramers are nonfunctional hemoglobins with very high oxygen affinity. They do not transport oxygen and result in extravascular hemolysis. A fetus with the most severe form of α-­ thalassemia (hydrops fetalis) develops in utero anemia and, without therapeutic intervention, the pregnancy usually results in fetal loss because HbF production requires sufficient amounts of α-­globin. In contrast, infants with β-­thalassemia major become symptomatic only after birth when HbA predominates and insufficient β-­globin produc- tion manifests in clinical symptoms. HOMOZYGOUS β-­THALASSEMIA (TRANSFUSION- DEPENDENT BETA THALASSEMIA, BETA THALASSEMIA MAJOR, COOLEY ANEMIA) Clinical Manifestations If not treated, children with homozygous β0-­thalassemia usually become symptomatic from progressive anemia, with weakness, poor growth, and cardiac decompensation during the second 6 months of life. Depending on the pathogenic variant and degree of HbF produc- tion, regular transfusions are necessary beginning in the second month to second year of life, but rarely later. The decision to transfuse is mul- tifactorial but is not determined solely by the degree of anemia. Per- sistent hemoglobin level below 7 g/dL in the absence of acute illness is an indication to start transfusions. In addition, the presence of signs of ineffective erythropoiesis, such as growth failure, bone deformities sec- ondary to marrow expansion, and hepatosplenomegaly, are important variables in determining transfusion initiation. The classic presentation of children with severe disease includes thalassemic facies (maxilla hyperplasia, flat nasal bridge, frontal bossing), pathologic bone fractures, marked hepatosplenomegaly, and cachexia and is primarily seen in countries without access to chronic transfusion therapy. Occasionally, patients with moderate anemia develop these fea- tures because of severe compensatory, ineffective erythropoiesis. In nontransfused patients with severe ineffective erythropoiesis, marked splenomegaly can develop with hypersplenism and abdom- inal symptoms. The features of ineffective erythropoiesis include expanded medullary spaces (with massive expansion of the marrow of the face and skull), extramedullary hematopoiesis, and higher metabolic needs (Fig. 511.7). The chronic anemia and increased erythroid drive produce an increase in iron absorption from the GI tract and secondary hemosiderosis-­induced organ injury. Chronic transfusion therapy dramatically improves the quality of life and reduces the complications of severe thalassemia. Transfusion-­ induced hemosiderosis becomes the major clinical complication of transfusion-­dependent thalassemia. Each mL of pure packed RBCs contains approximately 1 mg of iron. Physiologically, there is no mechanism to eliminate excess body iron. Iron is initially deposited in the liver and is followed by deposition in the endocrine organs and the heart. This leads to a high rate of hypothyroidism, hypogonado- tropic gonadism, growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. Iron deposition in the heart causes heart fail- ure and arrhythmias, and heart disease is the leading cause of death in inadequately chelated patients. Eventually, most patients not receiv- ing adequate iron chelation therapy die from cardiac failure or cardiac arrhythmias secondary to hemosiderosis. Hemosiderosis-­induced morbidity can be prevented by adequate iron chelation therapy. Laboratory Findings In the United States, some children with β-­thalassemia major will be identified on newborn screening because of the detection of only HbF on hemoglobin electrophoresis. However, infants with β+ pathogenic vari- ants might be missed on newborn screen if small amounts of hemoglobin Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

An HbFE pattern can be consistent with hemoglobin E β0-­ thalassemia, or the more benign hemoglobin EE disease, and needs to be followed up. The lack of standardized neonatal diagnosis of thalassemia disorders requires close follow-­up of newborns with unclear thalassemia pathogenic variants and babies from high-­risk ethnic groups. Infants with serious β-­thalassemia disorders have a progressive anemia after the newborn period. Microcytosis, hypochromia, and targeting characterize the RBCs. Nucleated RBCs, marked anisopoi- kilocytosis, and a relative reticulocytopenia are typically seen (see Fig. 511.5E). The Hb level falls progressively often to <6 g/dL unless transfusions are given. The reticulocyte count is commonly <8% and is inappropriately low compared to the degree of anemia caused by ineffective erythropoiesis. The unconjugated serum bilirubin level is usually elevated, but other chemistries may be initially normal. Even if the child does not receive transfusions, iron eventually accumulates with elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Evidence of bone marrow hyperplasia can be seen on radiographs (see Fig. 511.7). Early definitive diagnosis is recommended. Newborn screening techniques such as hemoglobin electrophoresis are not definitive. DNA diagnosis of the β-­thalassemia pathogenic variants, along with testing for common genetic modifiers of the clinical phenotype, is recommended. Co-­inheritance of one or more α-­thalassemia dele- tions is common, and it decreases the severity of the β-­thalassemia disease as it improves the α:β chain imbalance. Some patients’ patho- genic variants cannot be diagnosed by standard electrophoresis or common DNA probes. Referral of the samples to a tertiary labora- tory is indicated, along with parental and family testing. After the definitive diagnosis, families should undergo detailed counseling. Management and Treatment of Thalassemia See Figure 511.8. Transfusion Therapy β-­thalassemia major is a clinical diagnosis that requires the integra- tion of laboratory findings and clinical features. Of patients with homozygous β0-­thalassemia (the most severe pathogenic variants), 15–20% may have a clinical course that is phenotypically consis- tent with thalassemia intermedia. In contrast, 25% of patients with homozygous β+-­thalassemia, typically a more benign genotype, may have transfusion-­dependent thalassemia. Transient clinical events, such as a sudden fall in hemoglobin secondary to an episode of parvovirus requiring transfusion, do not necessarily indicate a transfusion-­dependent patient. The long-­term observation of the clinical characteristics, such as growth, bony changes, and hemo- globin, are necessary to determine chronic transfusion therapy.

Chapter 511  u  Hemoglobinopathies  2983 Guidelines for Transfusion Therapy.  Patients who require transfusion therapy should have an extended RBC phenotype and/ or genotype. Patients should receive RBCs depleted of leukocytes and matched for D, C, c, E, e, and Kell antigens at a minimum. Cytomegalovirus-­safe units are indicated in stem cell transplantation candidates. Transfusions should generally be given at intervals of 3-­4 weeks, with the goal being to maintain a pretransfusion Hb level of 9.5-­ 10.5 g/dL. Ongoing monitoring for transfusion-­associated transmit- ted infections (hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV), alloimmunization, annual blood transfusion requirements, and transfusion reactions is essential. Iron Overload Monitoring Excessive iron stores from transfusion cause many of the compli- cations of β-­thalassemia major. Accurate assessment of excessive iron stores is essential to optimal therapy. Serial serum ferritin levels provide a useful screening technique in assessing iron bal- ance trends, but results may not accurately predict quantitative iron stores. Undertreatment or overtreatment of presumed excessive iron stores can occur in managing a patient based on serum ferritin alone. Quantitative measurements of liver iron and cardiac iron by MRI are standard noninvasive methods to assess tissue iron over- load; estimation of pancreatic and gonadal iron is being studied. This technology, along with access to multiple chelators, enables targeted chelation therapy for patients with organ-­specific hemo- siderosis before the onset of overt organ failure. Integration of these imaging technologies with chelation therapy may prevent heart fail- ure, diabetes, and other organ dysfunction. Quantitative liver iron by approved R2 or R2* MRI is the best indicator of total body iron stores and should be obtained in patients after chronic transfusion therapy has been initiated. The liver iron results will help guide the chelation regimen. Cardiac iron estimation by T2* MRI, is usually obtained starting at 10 years old, but should be obtained earlier in the setting of severe iron overload or if the transfusion and chelation history is not known. There may be a discrepancy between the liver iron and the heart iron because of different rates of tissue loading and unloading and the differen- tial effects of iron chelators on organ-­specific iron removal. Chelation Therapy Iron-­chelation therapy should start as soon as the patient becomes significantly iron-­overloaded. In general, this occurs after 1 year of transfusion therapy and correlates with the serum ferritin >1,000 ng/ mL and/or a liver iron concentration of >5,000 μg/g dry weight. Iron chelation is not currently labeled for use in children <2 years. There are three available iron chelators (deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone); each varies in its route of administration, pharmaco- kinetics, adverse events, and efficacy (Table 511.8). Combination che- lation therapy may be required for high iron burden. The overall goal is to prevent hemosiderosis-­induced tissue injury and avoid chelation toxicity. This requires close monitoring of the patients. In general, che- lation toxicity increases as iron stores decrease. Deferoxamine (Desferal) is the most studied iron chelator; it has an excellent safety and efficacy profile. It requires subcutaneous or IV administration because of its poor oral bioavailability and short half-­ life of <30 minutes, necessitating administration as a continuous infu- sion over at least 8 hours daily, 5-­7 days/week. Deferoxamine is initially started at 25 mg/kg and can be increased to 60 mg/kg in heavily iron-­ overloaded patients. The major problem with deferoxamine is poor adherence because of the difficult, time-­consuming route of adminis- tration. Adverse side effects include local skin reactions, ototoxicity, retinal changes, and bone dysplasia with truncal shortening. Maintain- ing the therapeutic index (deferoxamine dose in mg/kg divided by the serum ferritin) below 0.025 limits these adverse effects. The oral iron chelator deferasirox is commercially available in the United States. Of patients treated with deferoxamine, 70% have switched to deferasirox because it is orally available. Deferasirox has a half-­life of >16 hours and requires once-­daily administration. The drug was initially available as a dispersible tablet that is dis- solved in water or juice. Subsequently, a film coated tablet that is swallowed whole and a granule form that is sprinkled on soft food and ingested became available. Dosing is different for the different deferasirox formulations. For the dispersible tablet form, the initial dose typically is 20 mg/kg/day and can be escalated to as high as 40 mg/kg/day based on the iron burden. The dosing for the film-­ coated tablet and granule forms is 30% lower than the dispersible tablet, with a starting dose of 14 mg/kg/day, which can be escalated to a maximum of 28 mg/kg/day. The most common side effects are GI symptoms, which may be lessened with the film-­coated tablet and granule formulations because they do not contain lactose and sodium laureate, which are found in the dispersible tablet and are thought to be responsible for some of the GI symptoms. The most serious side effect of deferasirox is potential kidney damage. Up to 30% of patients have transient increases in creatinine that may require temporary modifications of dosing. This toxicity may occur more commonly in the setting of dehydration. Proteinuria also can develop and, less commonly, a renal Fanconi syndrome may occur. Long-­term studies in thousands of patients have not demonstrated progressive renal dysfunction, but isolated cases of renal failure in patients have occurred. In addition, hepatic transaminitis may occur, with an increase to >5 times the upper limit of normal in approximately 8% of patients. All patients require monthly chemis- try panels and ongoing monitoring for proteinuria. Deferiprone, an oral iron chelator, is approved in the United States for use in individuals with transfusional iron overload 3 years and older. Deferiprone has a half-­life of approximately 3 hours and requires dosing 3 times daily; a new longer-­acting tablet form is available that is A B C Fig. 511.7  Ineffective erythropoiesis in a 3-­yr-­old patient who has β-­ thalassemia major and has not received a transfusion.

The starting dose is 75 mg/kg/day and can be esca- lated to 99 mg/kg/day based on the degree of iron overload. Deferi- prone, a small molecule, effectively enters cardiac tissue and may be more effective than other chelators in reducing cardiac hemosiderosis. The most serious side effect of deferiprone is transient agranulocytosis, which occurs in 1-2% of patients and usually in the first year of treat- ment. It has been associated with rare deaths where patients were not adequately monitored. The use of deferiprone requires frequent CBC monitoring, typically weekly for at least the first 6 months of therapy. Most importantly, the drug should be held and the neutrophil count checked immediately with all febrile illnesses. As thalassemia patients live longer, the iron chelation goals have changed. Aggressive treatment with combination chelation therapy is often used in heavily iron-­overloaded patients to prevent or reverse organ dysfunction. Deferoxamine, in combination with deferiprone, is routinely used in patients with increased cardiac iron. Combination therapy of deferoxamine and deferasirox or with deferasirox and defer- iprone may also be efficacious in patients with severe iron overload.

The drug is given by subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks at a starting dose of 1 mg/ kg/dose, which can be escalated to 1.25 mg/kg/dose if no response after 6 weeks of treatment. In patients with transfusion-­dependent β-­thalassemia, use of luspatercept was associated with a reduction in RBC requirements in about 70% of treated patients. Luspatercept is approved by the FDA for use in adults with transfusion-­dependent β-­thalassemia. Adverse effects include bone pain, arthralgia, dizziness, hypertension, and hyperuricemia. The drug also is being studied in nontransfusion dependent thalassemia, where a 1 to 1.5 g/dL rise in hemoglobin has been seen. Hydroxyurea Hydroxyurea, a DNA antimetabolite, increases HbF production. It has been most successfully used in sickle cell disease and in some patients with β-­thalassemia intermedia. Studies in β-­thalassemia major are lim- ited. In many parts of the world, hydroxyurea therapy is used in β-­ thalassemia intermedia patients. Even though increases in HbF levels are observed, they do not predictively correlate with increase in total Hb in these patients. In general, there appears to be a mean increase in Hb of 1 g/dL (range: 0.1-­2.5 g/dL). Hydroxyurea therapy in thalassemia intermedia is associated with a reduced risk of leg ulcers, pulmonary hypertension, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The initial starting dose for thalassemia intermedia is 10 mg/kg and may be escalated to 20 mg/kg/day. Patients with β-­thalassemia are at increased risk of developing cytopenias with hydroxyurea use, which may prevent dose escalation. Close monitoring of the CBC with differential is required. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Gene Therapy Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cured >3,000 patients who had β-­thalassemia major. In low-­risk HLA-­matched sibling patients, there is at least a 90% survival and an 80% event-­free survival. In general, myeloablative conditioning regimens have been used to prevent graft rejection and thalassemia recurrence. Most success has been in chil- dren <14 years old without excessive iron stores and hepatomegaly who undergo sibling HLA-­matched allogeneic transplantation. All children who have an HLA-­matched sibling should be offered the option of bone marrow transplantation. Outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell trans- plantation with a matched unrelated donor using molecular techniques for HLA typing have significantly improved, approaching outcomes with matched sibling donors, but with an increased risk of graft versus host disease. Alternative transplantation regimens for patients without appro- priate donors are experimental and have variable success. Gene therapy using gene addition or gene editing approaches are FDA approved for transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia. Results with gene addition using lentiviral vectors containing a functional β-­globin gene have been promising. Betibeglogene autotemcel is a rare gene-based, FDA- approved therapy for adults and pediatric patients  (≥4 years) with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia.

The first patient treated with transfusion-­ dependent thalassemia treated with a CRISPR-­Cas9 gene editing approach was able to discontinue RBC transfusions while maintaining a normal hemoglobin level, mostly consisting of HbF. This gene approach is indicated for transfusion-dependent ­β-thalassemia patients ≥12 years of age. Splenectomy Splenectomy may be required in thalassemia patients who develop hypersplenism. These patients have a falling steady-­state Hb level and/ or a rising transfusion requirement. However, splenectomy is less fre- quently used as a therapeutic option; serious adverse effects of splenec- tomy are increasingly recognized beyond infection risk. In thalassemia intermedia, splenectomized patients have a marked increased risk of venous thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, and silent cerebral infarction compared to nonsplenectomized patients. All patients should be fully immunized against encapsulated bacteria and receive appropriate instructions regarding fever management. Prophy- lactic penicillin should be administered after splenectomy to prevent sepsis, and families need to be educated on the risk of fever and sepsis. Preventive Monitoring of Thalassemia Patients See Table 511.9. Cardiac Disease Cardiac disease is the major cause of death in thalassemia. Serial echo- cardiograms should be monitored to evaluate cardiac function and pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary hypertension frequently occurs in non­transfusion dependent thalassemia patients and may be an indi- cation for transfusion therapy. After approximately 8 years of chronic transfusion therapy, cardiac hemosiderosis may occur; consequently, cardiac T2* MRI imaging studies are recommended, typically beginning at 10 years of age. Patients with cardiac hemosiderosis and decreasing cardiac ejection fraction require intensive combination chelation ther- apy. Periodic electrocardiogram studies also are obtained after age 10 years because of the risk of arrhythmia from cardiac iron overload. Endocrine Disease Endocrine function progressively declines with age secondary to hemo- siderosis and nutritional deficiencies. Iron deposition in the pituitary and endocrine organs can result in multiple endocrinopathies, including hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, delayed puberty, hypopara- thyroidism, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring for endocrine dysfunction starts early, about 5 years of age, or after at least 3 years of chronic transfusions. All children require monitoring of their height, weight, pubertal assessment, and sitting height semiannu- ally. Bone density scans should be obtained starting in the second decade of life given the high rate of osteopenia. Nutritional assessments are required. Most patients need vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc replacement. Fertility is a growing concern among patients and should be assessed routinely. Psychosocial Support Thalassemia imposes major disruption in the family unit and signifi- cant obstacles to normal development. Culturally sensitive anticipatory counseling is necessary, and the early use of child life services decreases psychologic trauma of therapy. Early social service consultation to address financial and social issues is mandatory. OTHER β-­THALASSEMIA SYNDROMES Non–Transfusion-­Dependent Thalassemia: β-­ Thalassemia Intermedia Non–transfusion-­dependent thalassemia (thalassemia interme- dia) includes a spectrum of patients who initially are not chroni- cally transfused in infancy but may be sporadically transfused throughout their lifetime. The major determining characteristic of these patients is less α-­β–globin chain imbalance than observed in thalassemia major. Sometimes, genetic modifiers alter the pri- mary pathogenic variant severity and improve the globin-­chain imbalance. Co-­inheritance of α-­thalassemia trait or polymor- phisms of globin promoters such as BCL11A may lessen disease severity and result in a nontransfusion dependent thalassemia. HbE β-­thalassemia is a common cause of both transfusion-­dependent and non–transfusion-­dependent thalassemia.

Chapter 511  u  Hemoglobinopathies  2987 genetic modifiers play a role in altering the severity of this disor- der. Occasionally, patients with a single β-­thalassemia pathogenic variant or autosomal dominant β-­thalassemia trait have clinical features of thalassemia intermedia, or non–transfusion-­dependent thalassemia. Genetic studies of these patients often uncover co-­ inheritance of genetic modifiers that worsens the condition, such as α-­gene triplication or an unstable β-­globin variant. Individuals with thalassemia intermedia have significant inef- fective erythropoiesis that leads to microcytic anemia with hemo- globin of approximately 7 g/dL (range: 6-­10 g/dL). These patients have some of the complications characterized in untransfused thalassemia major patients, but the severity varies depending on the degree of ineffective erythropoiesis. They can develop medul- lary hyperplasia, hepatosplenomegaly, hematopoietic pseudotu- mors, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, thrombotic events, and growth failure. Many patients develop hemosiderosis secondary to increased GI absorption of iron requiring chelation. Extramedul- lary hematopoiesis can occur in the vertebral canal, compressing the spinal cord and causing neurologic symptoms; the latter is a medical emergency requiring immediate local radiation therapy to halt erythropoiesis. Transfusions are indicated in thalassemia inter- media patients with significant clinical morbidity. Thalassemia trait is often misdiagnosed as iron deficiency in chil- dren because the two diagnoses produce similar hematologic abnor- malities on CBC. However, iron deficiency is much more prevalent. A short course of iron and reevaluation is all that is required to iden- tify children who will need further evaluation. Children who have β-­ thalassemia trait have a persistently normal RBC distribution width and low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), whereas patients with iron deficiency develop an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) with treatment. On Hb analysis, patients with β-­thalassemia trait have elevated levels of HbA2 and variably increased HbF. There are “silent” forms of β-­thalassemia trait, and if the family history is suggestive, fur- ther studies may be indicated. α-­THALASSEMIA SYNDROMES The same evolutionary pressures that produced β-­thalassemia and sickle cell disease produced α-­thalassemia. Infants are identified in the newborn period by the increased production of hemoglobin Bart’s (γ4) during fetal life and its presence at birth. The α-­thalassemia syn- dromes occur most frequently in Southeast Asia. Deletions are most common in α-­thalassemia. In addition to deletional pathogenic vari- ants, there are nondeletional α-­globin gene pathogenic variants, the most common being Constant Spring (αCSα); these variants cause a more severe anemia and clinical course than the deletional variants. Normally, there are four α-­globin genes. The different phenotypes in α-­ thalassemia largely result from whether one (α+-­thalassemia) or both (α0-­thalassemia) α-­globin genes are deleted in each of the two loci. The deletion of one α-­globin gene (silent carrier) is not identifiable hematologically. Specifically, no alterations are noted in the MCV and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Persons with this deletion are usually diagnosed after the birth of a child with a two-­gene deletion or HbH (β4), but some newborn screening programs report even low con- centrations of Hb Bart’s. During the newborn period, <3% Hb Bart’s is observed. The deletion of one α-­globin gene is common in Black persons. The deletion of two α-­globin genes results in α-­thalassemia trait. The α-­globin alleles can be lost in a trans (−α/−α) or cis (α,α/-­SEA) con- figuration. The trans or cis pathogenic variants can combine with other pathogenic variants or deletions and lead to HbH or α-­thalassemia major. In persons from Africa or of African descent, the most common α-­globin deletions are in the trans configuration, whereas in persons from or descended from Asia or the Mediterranean region, cis dele- tions are most common. α-­Thalassemia trait (two missing α-­globin genes) manifests as a microcytic anemia that can be mistaken for iron-­deficiency anemia (see Fig. 511.5F). The Hb analysis is normal, except during the new- born period, when Hb Bart’s is typically <8% but >3%. Children with a deletion of two α-­globin genes are commonly mistaken to have iron deficiency, given the presence of both low MCV and MCH. The simplest approach to distinguish between iron deficiency and α-­ thalassemia trait is with a good dietary history. Children with iron-­ deficiency anemia often have a diet that is low in iron and drink a significant amount of cow’s milk. Alternatively, a brief course of iron supplementation along with monitoring of erythrocyte param- eters might confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency. If both parents of a child diagnosed with α-­thalassemia trait are carriers in the cis conformation, they are at risk for a future hydrops fetalis pregnancy. Thus family screening and genetic counseling are indicated. The deletion of three α-­globin genes leads to the diagnosis of HbH disease. A more severe form of HbH disease may be caused by a non- deletional α-­globin pathogenic variant in combination with two gene deletions. HbH Constant Spring (−α/α,αCS) is the most common type of nondeletional HbH disease. In California, where a large population of persons of Asian descent resides, approximately 1:10,000 of all newborns have HbH disease. The simplest manner of diagnosing HbH disease is during the newborn period, when excess in γ-­tetramers are present and Hb Bart’s is com- monly >25%. Obtaining supporting evidence from the parents is help- ful. Later in childhood, there is an excess of β-­globin chain tetramers that results in HbH. A definitive diagnosis of HbH disease requires DNA analysis. Brilliant cresyl blue can stain HbH, but it is rarely used for diagnosis. Patients with HbH disease have a marked microcyto- sis, anemia, mild splenomegaly, and, occasionally, scleral icterus or cholelithiasis. Chronic transfusion is not usually required for therapy because the Hb range is 7-­11 g/dL, with MCV 51-­73 fL, but intermit- tent transfusions for worsening anemia, particularly in the setting of acute infection, may be needed. Individuals with nondeletional HbH disease are more likely to require transfusions than individuals with deletional HbH disease. The deletion of all four α-­globin gene alleles causes profound anemia during fetal life, resulting in hydrops fetalis; the ζ-­globin gene must be present for fetal survival. There are no normal hemoglobins present at birth (primarily Hb Bart’s, with Hb Gower-­1, Gower-­2, and Portland). Intrauterine transfusions may rescue the fetus, but congenital abnor- malities and neurodevelopmental delay often result. Infants with severe α-­thalassemia will have lifelong transfusion dependence, and hemato- poietic stem cell transplantation is the only cure. Treatment of HbH disease requires ongoing monitoring of growth and organ dysfunction. Dietary supplement with folate and multivita- mins without iron is indicated. Older patients may develop decreased bone density with calcium and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation is indicated if the level is low, and adequate dietary calcium intake should be encouraged to promote bone health. Iron supplementation should be avoided as patients are at risk of devel- oping iron overload. Intermittent transfusion requirements during intercurrent infection may occur, particularly in nondeletional HbH. Splenectomy is occasionally indicated, and because of the high risk of postsplenectomy thrombosis, aspirin or other anticoagulant therapy after splenectomy should be considered. Hemosiderosis, secondary to GI iron absorption or transfusion exposure, may develop in older patients and require chelation therapy. Because HbH is an unstable hemoglobin sensitive to oxidative injury, oxidative medications should be avoided. At-­risk couples for hydrops fetalis should be identified and offered molecular diagnosis on fetal tissue obtained early in pregnancy. Later in pregnancy, intrauterine transfusion can improve fetal survival, but chronic transfusion therapy or bone marrow transplantation for survivors will be required.

Brandow Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia occurs in persons homozygous or compound heterozygous for autosomal recessive genes that cause either a marked reduction in red blood cell (RBC) pyruvate kinase (PK) or production of an abnormal enzyme with decreased catalytic activity resulting in impaired conversion of phosphoenol- pyruvate to pyruvate. Generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within RBCs at this step is impaired, and low levels of ATP, pyruvate, and the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) are found (Fig. 512.1). The concentration of 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate is increased; this isomer is beneficial in facilitating oxygen release from hemoglobin but detrimental in inhibiting hexokinase and enzymes of the hexose monophosphate shunt. This decrease of hemoglobin oxy- gen affinity leads to a rightward shift of the hemoglobin-­oxygen dis- sociation curve and therefore improved oxygen delivery manifesting as tolerance of anemia more than expected for the degree of severity. In addition, an unexplained decrease occurs in the sum of the ade- nine (ATP, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine monophosphate) and pyridine (NAD+ and reduced form of NAD) nucleotides, further impairing glycolysis. Because of decreased ATP, RBCs cannot main- tain their potassium and water content; the cells become rigid, and their life span is considerably reduced with precipitous destruction in the liver and/or spleen. This is more pronounced in reticulocytes, which require higher levels of ATP. ETIOLOGY There are two mammalian PK genes, but only the PKLR gene is expressed in RBCs. More than 300 pathogenic variants are reported in this structural gene, which codes for a 574–amino acid protein that forms a functional tetramer. There is some correlation of the type, loca- tion, and amino acid substitution with disease severity. The majority of patients have at least one missense pathogenic variant. Most affected patients are compound heterozygotes for two different PK gene defects. The many possible combinations likely account for the variability in clinical severity. The pathogenic variants 1456 C to T and 1529 G to A are the most common pathogenic variants in the White population. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND LABORATORY FINDINGS The clinical manifestations of PK deficiency vary from severe neona- tal hemolytic anemia to mild, well-­compensated hemolysis first noted in adulthood (Table 512.1). Perinatal complications include prema- ture birth, prenatal anemia or fetal hydrops requiring transfusions, and preterm labor. Severe hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and, in rare cases, hepatic failure may occur in the neonatal period, and kernic- terus has been reported. The hemolysis in older children and adults varies in severity, with hemoglobin values ranging from 2-­14 g/dL in various reports and associated pallor, jaundice, scleral icterus, spleno- megaly, bone deformities due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and hyperpigmentation. Reticulocyte counts are often extremely elevated, reflecting the severe ongoing hemolysis. Associated serum chemistries consistent with nonimmune hemolytic anemia are present, including an elevated indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), negative direct antiglobulin test (DAT), and Chapter 512 Enzymatic Defects Glucose Cysteine Glutamic acid Glycine Fructose-6-P Fructose-1,6-diP ATP ADP Hexokinase ATP ADP Phosphofructokinase Aldolase Glucose 6-P NADPH NADP Oxidized glutathione Reduced glutathione (Anti-oxidant) H2O H2O2 Glucosephosphate isomerase Glyceraldehyde-3-P Dihydroxyacetone-P 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate NAD NADP Glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase 1,3-Diphosphoglycerate ADP Pyruvate kinase Pyruvate Lactate Phosphoglycerate mutase Diphosphoglycerate mutase Diphosphoglycerate phosphatase 2-Phosphoglycerate Enolase 2-Phosphoenolpyruvate ADP [Energy] ATP [Energy] ATP NADH Lactate dehydrogenase NAD Phosphoglycerate kinase 1,3-Phosphoglycerate Glucose-6-P dehydrogenase 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase Glutathione peroxidase Triosephosphate isomerase Glutathione reductase -glutamylcysteine synthetase Glutathione synthetase Anaerobic glycolysis Hexose Monophosphate Shunt Fig. 512.1  Red blood cell metabolism: glycolysis and hexose monophosphate pathway.

A severe form of the disease has a relatively high incidence among the Amish of the Midwestern United States (homozygous splicing pathogenic variant R479H). PK deficiency may possibly provide protection against falciparum malaria. There are long-­term effects of chronic hemolysis, including folate deficiency, skin ulcers, gallstones, increased risk of bone fractures, and risk of transient bone marrow aplasia associated with certain viral infections. Polychromatophilia and mild macrocytosis reflect the elevated reticulocyte count. Spherocytes are uncommon, but a few spiculated pyknocytes may be found. Diagnosis relies on demonstration of a marked reduction of RBC PK activity or an increase in the Michaelis-­ Menten dissociation constant (Km) for its substrate, phosphoenol- pyruvate (high Km variant). Other RBC enzyme activity is normal or elevated, reflecting the reticulocytosis. No abnormalities of hemoglo- bin are noted. The white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets have normal PK activity and must be rigorously excluded from the RBC hemoly- sates used to measure PK activity. Fructose 1,6-­disphosphate (FDP) must also be removed because it is an allosteric activator of PK. Hetero- zygous carriers usually have moderately reduced levels of PK activity. Molecular testing provides additional evidence for the disease. How- ever, due to genotype-­phenotype variability with unclear pathogenicity regarding variants, it is recommended to perform initial biochemical testing. TREATMENT Intrauterine RBC transfusions are performed in the setting of severe anemia associated with fetal hydrops. Phototherapy and exchange trans- fusions may be indicated for hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. Trans- fusions of packed RBCs are necessary for severe anemia or for aplastic crises. If the anemia is consistently severe and frequent transfusions are required, iron chelation may be necessary. Splenectomy should be considered after the child is 5-­6 years of age to decrease the need for transfusions and minimize iron overload. Although not curative, sple- nectomy may be followed by higher Hb levels and by strikingly high (30–60%) reticulocyte counts. Death resulting from overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis has followed splenectomy; thus immunization with vaccines for encapsulated organisms should be given before sple- nectomy and prophylactic penicillin administered after the procedure. Splenectomy has also been associated with thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension. There is currently no standard curative therapy, although the role of gene therapy and hematopoietic cell transplant are actively being investigated. An oral allosteric PK activator (mitapivat) is being studied in clinical trials involving adults and is under review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The natural history of the dis- ease is limited and is currently being studied through an international registry. 512.2  Other Glycolytic Enzyme Deficiencies Allison S. Remiker and Amanda M. Brandow Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemias of varying severity have been associated with deficiencies of other enzymes in the glyco- lytic pathway, including hexokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase, and aldolase, which are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. Phosphofructokinase deficiency, which occurs primarily in Ash- kenazi Jews in the United States, results in hemolysis associated with a myopathy classified as glycogen storage disease type VII (see Chapter 107.1).

Enzyme assays for phosphofructokinase yield low values for RBCs and muscle. Triose phosphate isomerase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting many systems. Affected patients have hemolytic ane- mia, cardiac abnormalities, and lower motor neuron and pyramidal tract impairment, with or without evidence of cerebral impairment. They usually die in early childhood. The gene for triose phosphate isomerase has been cloned and sequenced and is located on chromo- some 12. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is the first ATP-­generating step in glycolysis. At least 23 kindreds with PGK deficiency have been described. PGK is the only glycolytic enzyme inherited on the X chromosome. PGK is important in erythrocytes, the central ner- vous system (CNS), and skeletal muscle. The phenotype is quite variable and may affect one isolated tissue or a combination of all three. Affected males may present with dysfunction of the CNS with seizures, intellectual disability, and nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia; hemolytic anemia without CNS involvement; or myopathy, myoglobinuria, and progressive weakness. Some patients present with parkinsonism. Female heterozygotes have been shown to have partial symptoms depending on their degree of enzymatic activ- ity, including signs of hemolysis. The gene for PGK is particularly large, spanning 23 kb, and various genetic abnormalities, includ- ing nucleotide substitutions, gene deletions, missense, and splicing pathogenic variants, result in PGK deficiency. DEFICIENCIES OF ENZYMES OF HEXOSE MONOPHOSPHATE PATHWAY The most important function of the hexose monophosphate path- way is to maintain glutathione in its reduced state (GSH) as protec- tion against the oxidation of RBCs (see Fig. 512.1). Approximately 10% of the glucose taken up by RBCs passes through this pathway to provide the reduced form of NAD phosphate (NADPH) neces- sary for the conversion of oxidized glutathione to GSH. Mainte- nance of GSH is essential for the physiologic inactivation of oxidant compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide, that are generated within RBCs. If glutathione, or any compound or enzyme necessary for maintaining it in the reduced state, is decreased, the SH groups of the RBC membrane are oxidized, and the Hb becomes denatured and may precipitate into RBC inclusions called Heinz bodies. Once Heinz bodies have formed, an acute hemolytic process results from damage to the RBC membrane by the precipitated Hb, the oxidant agent, and the action of the spleen. The damaged RBCs then are rapidly removed from the circulation. 512.3  Glucose-­6-­Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency and Related Deficiencies Allison S. Remiker and Amanda M. Brandow Glucose-­6-­phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the most frequent disease involving enzymes of the hexose monophosphate pathway, is responsible for two clinical syndromes: episodic acute hemolytic anemia and chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The most common manifestations are neonatal jaundice and episodic acute hemolytic anemia, which is induced by infections, certain drugs, and, rarely, fava beans. This X-­linked deficiency affects >400 million people worldwide, representing an overall 4.9% global prevalence. The global distribution of this disorder parallels that of malaria, representing an example of “balanced polymorphism,” in which there is an evolution- ary advantage of resistance to falciparum malaria in heterozygous females that outweighs the small negative effect of affected hemizygous males. The deficiency is caused by inheritance of any of a large number of abnormal alleles of the gene responsible for the synthesis of the G6PD protein. Over 200 pathogenic variants have been described in the gene responsible for the synthesis of the G6PD protein. Many of these pathogenic variants are missense point pathogenic variants leading to amino acid substitutions and destabilization of the G6PD enzyme. ­Figure 512.2 shows some of the pathogenic variants that cause episodic versus chronic hemolysis. Milder disease is associ- ated with pathogenic variants near the amino terminus of the G6PD molecule, and chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is associ- ated with pathogenic variants clustered near the carboxyl terminus near the G6P and NADP-­binding sites. The normal enzyme found in most populations is designated G6PD B+. A normal variant, des- ignated G6PD A+, is common in Americans of African descent. EPISODIC OR INDUCED ACUTE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA Etiology G6PD catalyzes the conversion of glucose 6-­phosphate to 6-­phosphogluconic acid. This reaction produces NADPH, which main- tains GSH (glutathione in its reduced, functional state; see Fig. 512.1). GSH provides protection against oxidant threats from certain drugs and infections that would otherwise cause precipitation of hemoglobin (Heinz bodies) or damage the RBC membrane. Synthesis of RBC G6PD is determined by a gene on the X chro- mosome. Thus heterozygous females have intermediate enzymatic activity and have two populations of RBCs: one is normal, and the other is deficient in G6PD activity. Because they have fewer suscep- tible cells, most heterozygous females do not have clinically evident hemolysis after exposure to oxidant drugs. Rarely, the majority of RBCs is G6PD deficient in heterozygous females because the inac- tivation of the normal X chromosome is random and sometimes exaggerated. Disease involving this enzyme therefore occurs more frequently in males than in females. Approximately 13% of male Ameri- cans of African descent have a variant enzyme (G6PD A−) that results in a deficiency of RBC G6PD activity (5–15% of normal). Italians, Greeks, and other Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Afri- can, and Asian ethnic groups also have a high incidence, ranging from 5–40%, of a variant designated G6PD B− (G6PD Mediterra- nean). In these variants, the G6PD activity of homozygous females or hemizygous males is <5% of normal. Therefore the defect in Americans of African descent is less severe than that in Americans of European descent. A third variant enzyme with greatly reduced activity (G6PD Canton) occurs in approximately 5% of the Chinese population.

Chapter 512  u  Enzymatic Defects  2991 Clinical Manifestations Most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic, with no clinical manifestations of illness unless triggered by infection, drugs, or ingestion of fava beans. Typically, hemolysis ensues in about 24-­96 hours after a patient has ingested a substance with oxidant properties. In severe cases, hemoglobinuria and jaun- dice result, and the Hb concentration may fall precipitously. Drugs that elicit hemolysis in these individuals include fluoroquinolones, methylene blue, sulfonylureas, rasburicase, and antimalarials, such as primaquine and dapsone (Table 512.2). There is mixed evidence regarding the safety data of aspirin and sulfa-­containing medica- tions, which are generally thought to be safe. Chemical exposures to henna compounds and naphthalene (e.g., mothballs and deodor- ant) have also been implicated. The degree of hemolysis varies with the inciting agent, amount ingested, and severity of the enzyme deficiency. In some individuals, ingestion of fava beans also pro- duces an acute, severe hemolytic syndrome, known as favism. Fava beans contain divicine, isouramil, and convicine, which ultimately lead to production of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen products. Favism is thought to be more frequently associated with the G6PD Mediterranean and G6PD Canton variants. In the G6PD A− variant, the stability of the folded protein dimer is impaired, and this defect is accentuated as the RBCs age. Thus hemolysis decreases as older RBCs are destroyed, even if admin- istration of the drug is continued. This recovery results from the age-­labile enzyme, which is abundant and more stable in younger RBCs (Fig. 512.3). The associated reticulocytosis produces a com- pensated hemolytic process in which the blood hemoglobin may be only slightly decreased, despite continued exposure to the offending agent. G6PD deficiency can produce hemolysis in the neonatal period. In G6PD A–, spontaneous hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia have been observed in preterm infants. In newborns with the G6PD B− and G6PD Canton varieties, hyperbilirubinemia and even kernic- terus may occur. Neonates with co-­inheritance of G6PD deficiency and a pathogenic variant of the promoter of uridine-­diphosphate-­ glucuronyl transferase (UGT1A1), seen in Gilbert syndrome, have more severe neonatal jaundice. When a pregnant woman ingests oxidant drugs, they may be transmitted to her G6PD-­deficient fetus, and hemolytic anemia and jaundice may be apparent at birth. Similarly, medications may be transmitted to a neonate through breast milk. Laboratory Findings The onset of acute hemolysis usually results in a precipitous fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit. If the episode is severe, the Hb-­binding proteins, such as haptoglobin, are saturated, and free hemoglobin may appear in the plasma and subsequently in the urine. Hemolysis is intravascular and extravascular. Unstained or supravital preparations of RBCs reveal precipitated hemoglobin, or Heinz bodies. The RBC inclusions are not visible on the Wright-­stained blood film. Cells that contain these inclusions are seen only within the first 3-­4 days of ill- ness because they are rapidly cleared from the blood. Also, the blood film may contain RBCs with what appears to be a bite taken from their periphery (“bite cells”) and polychromasia (evidence of bluish, larger RBCs), representing reticulocytosis (Fig. 512.4). Diagnosis The diagnosis depends on direct or indirect demonstration of reduced G6PD activity in RBCs. By direct measurement, enzyme activity in affected persons is ≤10% of normal, and the reduction of enzyme activ- ity is more extreme in Americans of European descent and in Asians than in Americans of African descent. Satisfactory screening tests are based on decolorization of methylene blue, reduction of methemo- globin, or fluorescence of NADPH. Confirmatory testing is available using quantitative NADPH formation measured spectrophotometri- cally. Immediately after a hemolytic episode, reticulocytes and young RBCs predominate. These young cells have significantly higher enzyme activity than do older cells in the A− variety (African). Testing may therefore have to be deferred for a few weeks before a diagnostically low Table 512.2     	 Agents Precipitating Hemolysis in Glucose-­6-­Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency DEFINITE RISK OF AHA “POSSIBLE” RISK OF AHA POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION (LESS LIKELY) ANTIMALARIAL DRUGS Dapsone Chloroquine Pamaquine Quinidine Primaquine Quinine Tafenoquine OTHER DRUGS Ciprofloxacin Aspirin* Chloramphenicol Glibenclamide Menadiol sodium phosphate Dimercaptosuccinic acid Methylene blue Sulfadiazine Glibenclamide Moxifloxacin Sulfasalazine Mepacrine Nalidixic acid Sulfonylureas Vitamin K analogs Nitrofurantoin Tolonium chloride Norfloxacin Ofloxacin Phenazopyridine Rasburicase and pegloticase Sulfamethoxazole/cotrimoxazole Henna (cosmetic use) *Hemolysis is dose related.

The diagnosis can be suspected when G6PD activity is within the low-­normal range in the presence of a high reticulocyte count. G6PD variants also can be detected by electropho- retic and molecular analysis. G6PD deficiency should be considered in any neonatal patients with hyperbilirubinemia and borderline low G6PD activity. Prevention and Treatment Prevention of hemolysis constitutes the most important therapeutic measure. When possible, males belonging to ethnic groups with a sig- nificant incidence of G6PD deficiency (e.g., Greeks, southern Italians, Sephardic Jews, Filipinos, southern Chinese, Black Americans, Thais) should be tested for the defect before known oxidant drugs are given. The usual doses of aspirin and trimethoprim-­sulfamethoxazole do not cause clinically relevant hemolysis in the A− variety. Aspirin admin- istered in doses used for acute rheumatic fever (50-­100 mg/kg/24 hr) may produce a severe hemolytic episode. Infants with severe neona- tal jaundice who belong to these ethnic groups also require testing for G6PD deficiency because of their heightened risk for this defect. If severe hemolysis has occurred, supportive therapy may require blood transfusions, although recovery is the rule when the oxidant agent is discontinued. CHRONIC HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFICIENCY OF G6PD OR RELATED FACTORS Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia has been associated with profound deficiency of G6PD caused by enzyme variants, par- ticularly those defective in quantity, activity, or stability. The gene defects leading to chronic hemolysis are located primarily in the region of the NADP-­binding site near the carboxyl terminus of the protein (see Fig. 512.2). These include the Loma Linda, Tomah, Iowa, Beverly Hills, Nashville, Riverside, Santiago de Cuba, and Andalus variants. Persons with G6PD B− enzyme deficiency occa- sionally have chronic hemolysis, and the hemolytic process may worsen after ingestion of oxidant drugs. Splenectomy is of little value in these types of chronic hemolysis. Other enzyme defects may impair the regeneration of GSH as an oxidant “sump” (see Fig. 512.1). Mild, chronic nonspherocytic anemia has been reported in association with decreased RBC GSH, resulting from γ-­glutamylcysteine or GSH synthetase deficiencies. Deficiency of 6-­phosphogluconate dehydrogenase has been associated primarily with drug-­induced hemolysis, and hemolysis with hyperbilirubinemia has been related to a deficiency of GSH peroxidase in newborn infants.

Chapter 513  u  Hemolytic Anemias Resulting from Extracellular Factors—Immune Hemolytic Anemias   2993 IMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS A number of extrinsic agents and disorders may lead to premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) at a rate where hemolysis exceeds hematopoietic replacement. Among the most clearly defined are antibod- ies associated with immune hemolytic anemias. The hallmark of this group of diseases is the positive result of the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT), which detects a coating of immunoglobulin or components of complement on the RBC surface. The most important immune hemolytic disorder in pediatric practice is hemolytic disease of the newborn (eryth- roblastosis fetalis), caused by transplacental transfer of maternal antibody active against the RBCs of the fetus, that is, isoimmune hemolytic anemia (see Chapter 140). Various other immune hemolytic anemias are autoimmune (Table 513.1). Often, no underlying cause can be found; this is the pri- mary or idiopathic type. If the autoimmune hemolysis is associated with an underlying disease, including various infections (Epstein-­Barr virus [EBV], rarely HIV, cytomegalovirus, and mycoplasma), autoimmune or inflammatory diseases (autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease [ALPS], systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, ulcerative colitis), primary immunodeficiency diseases (com- mon variable immunodeficiency [CVID], Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome), neoplasms (lymphoproliferative, solid tumors), or posttransplant (solid organ or allogeneic stem cell), it is considered secondary (Table 513.2). As many as 20% of episodes of autoimmune hemolysis are drug-­induced (e.g., Chapter 513 Hemolytic Anemias Resulting from Extracellular Factors— Immune Hemolytic Anemias Allison S.

Other drugs (penicillins, cephalosporins) cause hemolysis by means of “drug-­dependent antibod- ies”—antibodies directed toward the drug and in some cases toward an RBC membrane antigen as well. Etiology Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is caused by the production of anti-­RBC autoantibodies generated by tissue and self-­reactive B lympho- cytes circulating in the periphery supported by T helper lymphocytes. The complement system induces sequential activation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) leading to erythrocyte lysis typically in the liver and circulation. RBCs are opsonized by the autoantibodies or complement then phagocytosed primarily in the spleen and lymph tissue. Antibody-­ dependent cell-­mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) induced by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells are an additional important mechanism contributing to AIHA also predominantly in lymphoid organs and the spleen. The underlying cause of autoimmunity is loss of central self-­tolerance in the early stages of lymphocyte differentiation, as well as loss of peripheral self-­tolerance driven by Tregs and CD8+ suppressor T lymphocytes. Loss of tolerance allows for autoreactive cells to avoid negative selection, and/or suppression of autoantibodies fails to occur appropriately in the periphery. It is theorized patients who develop AIHA have an underlying predisposi- tion to losing such self-­tolerance, which is stimulated by environmental factors. The autoantibody may be produced as an inappropriate immune response to an RBC antigen or to another antigenic epitope similar to an RBC antigen, known as molecular mimicry. Alternatively, an infectious agent may alter the RBC membrane so that it becomes “foreign” or anti- genic to the host. The autoantibodies that form in AIHA have antibody class, antigenic reactivity, and thermal characteristics associated with binding and/or destroying erythrocytes. The temperature predilection is associated with corresponding nomenclature, including warm (wAIHA), cold (cold agglutinin disease [CAD]), paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH), and rare mixed forms. AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH “WARM” ANTIBODIES Etiology Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is the most common form in children found in as many as 90% of cases. Autoantibodies are “warm-­reactive” meaning they preferentially bind to erythrocytes at 37°C. Extravascular hemolysis occurs in the spleen. Typically, the antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and react to epitopes (antigens) that are “public” or common to all human RBCs, such as Rh proteins. When IgG is present in exceptional quantity, it can fix complement, which results in intravascular hemolysis. Clinical Manifestations Patients with wAIHA present with symptoms consistent with anemia and nonspecific signs of hemolysis. Onset may be acute, with pallor, jaundice, icterus, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, fever, shortness of breath, and dizziness, or more gradual with primarily fatigue and pal- lor. Cardiovascular compromise is rare. The spleen is usually enlarged and is the primary site of destruction of IgG-­coated RBCs. Laboratory Findings In many cases, anemia is profound with hemoglobin (Hb) levels <6 g/dL. Considerable spherocytosis and polychromasia (reflecting the reticulocyte response) are present. More than 50% of the circulating RBCs may be reticulocytes, and nucleated RBCs usually are present. In some cases, a low reticulocyte count may be found, particularly early in the episode due to similar epitopes on RBC precursors in the marrow, marrow suppression if there is concurrent infection, and/ or a “shocked” marrow after a severe hemolytic event. Leukocyto- sis is common. The platelet count is usually normal, but concomi- tant immune thrombocytopenic purpura sometimes occurs (Evans syndrome). Patients with Evans syndrome often have or eventually develop a chronic disease, including SLE, an immunodeficiency syndrome (common variable immunodeficiency), or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. Results of the DAT (Coombs test) are strongly positive, and free anti- body can sometimes be demonstrated in the serum (indirect Coombs test). These antibodies are active at 35–40°C (95–104°F) (“warm” anti- bodies) and most often belong to the IgG class. They do not require com- plement for activity. Antibodies from the serum and those eluted from the RBCs react with the RBCs of many persons in addition to those of the patient. They often have been regarded as nonspecific panagglutinins, but careful studies have revealed specificity for RBC antigens of the Rh system in 70% of patients (50% of adult patients). Complement, particu- larly fragments of C3b, may be detected on the RBCs in conjunction with IgG. The Coombs test result is rarely negative because of the sensitivity of the Coombs reaction. A minimum of 260-­400 molecules of IgG per cell is necessary on the RBC membrane to produce a positive reaction. Special tests are required to detect the antibody in cases of “Coombs-­ negative” autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In warm antibody hemolytic anemia, the direct Coombs test may detect IgG alone, both IgG and com- plement fragments, or solely complement fragments if the level of RBC-­ bound IgG is below the detection limit of the anti-­IgG Coombs reagent. Treatment Transfusions may provide only transient benefit but may be lifesav- ing in cases of severe anemia until the effects of other treatments are observed. All tested units for transfusion are serologically incompat- ible. It is important to identify the patient’s ABO blood group to avoid a hemolytic transfusion reaction mediated by anti-­A or anti-­B. The blood bank should also test for the presence of an underlying alloanti- body, which could cause rapid hemolysis of transfused RBCs. Patients who have been neither previously transfused nor pregnant are unlikely to harbor an alloantibody. Early consultation between the clinician and the blood bank physician is essential. Failure to transfuse a profoundly anemic infant or child may lead to serious morbidity and even death. Patients with mild disease and compensated hemolysis may not require treatment. If the hemolysis is severe and results in significant anemia or symptoms, treatment with glucocorticoids is initiated. Glucocorticoids decrease the rate of hemolysis by blocking macrophage function through downregulating Fcγ receptor expression, decreasing the production of the autoantibody, and perhaps enhancing the elution of antibody from the RBCs. Initial dosing is dependent on the degree of anemia and symptoms. In patients who present with Hb <6 to 7 g/dL or severe symptoms, initial treatment with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 0.5-­1 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours in the first 24-­72 hours is typically indicated. With rapid deterio- ration or severity of anemia, high-­dose methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg with maximum 1 g daily for 3 days may be required. When hemolytic anemia remains severe despite glucocorticoid therapy, or if very large doses are necessary to maintain a reasonable Hb level, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be tried. Long-­term use of IVIG has not been shown to be effective in the majority of children. In children who present with mild to moderate anemia with Hg ≥7 to 8 g/dL and an appropriate reticulocyte count, oral prednisone 2 mg/kg/day may be started. Response is typically seen within 2-­4 weeks after initiation of steroids and considered adequate with Hb concentration >9 to 10 g/dL. Hb, reticulocyte count, lactate dehy- drogenase, and DAT should be monitored for response. Treatment should be continued until the rate of hemolysis decreases, with the dose then gradually reduced, typically over at least 4 months. The Coombs test result may remain positive even after the Hb level returns to normal. It is usually safe to discontinue prednisone once the direct Coombs test result becomes negative. The majority of patients (approximately 80%) have an initial response to glucocorticoids within the first month of treatment; however, it is common to require prolonged or multimodal therapies over time. If a patient is unable to taper prednisone effectively within 1-­2 months after diagnosis, addition of a second-­line therapy should be considered. Relapse occurs in 15–40% of patients with wAIHA, typically within the first 6-­12 months after initial response to treatment. If this occurs, resumption of the lowest dose of prednisone that was effective in treating the patient is recommended. Because of the adverse effects of long-­term steroid use, alternative agents could be considered if relapse continues to occur.

Chapter 513  u  Hemolytic Anemias Resulting from Extracellular Factors—Immune Hemolytic Anemias   2995 There are limited data in second-­line therapies for wAIHA in children. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets B lymphocytes, the source of antibody production, is useful in chronic cases refractory to conventional therapy. Plasmapheresis has been used in refractory cases but generally is not helpful because most hemolysis is in the extravascular space. Splenec- tomy may be beneficial but is complicated by a heightened risk of infection with encapsulated organisms, particularly in patients <6 years old. Prophy- laxis is indicated with appropriate vaccines (pneumococcal, meningococ- cal, and Haemophilus influenzae type b) before splenectomy and with oral penicillin after splenectomy. Thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension are also increasingly recognized problems after splenectomy. In refractory disease, several immunomodulating agents have been used in small case series or reports including azathioprine, 6-­mercaptopurine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., obinutuzumab, daratumumab, alemtuzumab, bortezomib). Prognosis Acute idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic disease in childhood varies in severity but is self-­limited; death from untreatable anemia is rare. Approximately 30% of patients have chronic hemolysis, often associ- ated with an underlying disease, such as SLE, immunodeficiency, or lymphoma. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in adult patients with immune hemolysis predisposes to thrombosis. Mortality in chronic cases depends on the primary disorder. AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH “COLD” ANTIBODIES OR COLD AGGLUTININ DISEASE “Cold” antibodies agglutinate RBCs at temperatures <37°C (98.6°F). They are primarily of the IgM class and require complement for hemo- lytic activity. The highest temperature at which RBC agglutination occurs is called the thermal amplitude. A higher thermal amplitude antibody—that is, one that can bind to RBCs at temperatures achiev- able in the body—results in hemolysis with exposure to a cold environ- ment. High antibody titers are associated with high thermal amplitude. Cold antibodies usually have specificity for the oligosaccharide antigens of the I/i system. They may occur in primary or idiopathic cold agglutinin disease, secondary to infections such as those from Mycoplasma pneumoniae and EBV, or secondary to lymphoprolifera- tive disorders. After M. pneumoniae infection, the anti-­I levels may increase considerably, and occasionally, enormous increases may occur to titers ≥1/30,000. The antibody has specificity for the I antigen and thus reacts poorly with human cord RBCs, which possess the i anti- gen but exhibit low levels of I. Patients with infectious mononucleosis occasionally have CAD, and the antibodies in these patients often have anti-­i specificity. This antibody causes less hemolysis in adults than in children because adults have fewer i molecules on their RBCs. Spon- taneous RBC agglutination is observed in the cold and in vitro, and RBC aggregates are seen on the blood film (rouleaux formation). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) may be spuriously elevated because of RBC agglutination and reticulocytosis. The severity of the hemolysis is related to the thermal amplitude of the antibody, which itself partly depends on the IgM antibody titer. When very high titers of cold antibodies are present and active near body temperature, severe intravascular hemolysis with hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria may occur and may be heightened on a patient’s exposure to cold (external temperature or ingested foods). Each IgM mol- ecule has the potential to activate a C1 molecule, so that large amounts of complement are found on the RBCs in CAD. These sensitized RBCs may undergo intravascular complement-­mediated lysis or may be destroyed in the liver and spleen. Only complement, not IgM, is detected on RBCs because the IgM is removed during the washing steps of the DAT. CAD is less common in children than in adults and more frequently results in an acute, self-­limited episode of hemolysis. RBC transfusion is indicated based on symptoms and severity of anemia. If transfusion is required, blood should be warmed before administration. Glucocor- ticoids are much less effective in CAD than in hemolytic disease with warm antibodies. Patients should avoid exposure to cold and should be treated for any underlying disease. In the uncommon patient with severe hemolytic disease, immunosuppression and plasmapheresis can be used. Successful treatment of CAD has been reported with rituximab, which effectively depletes B lymphocytes. Splenectomy is not useful in CAD. Paroxysmal Cold Hemoglobinuria Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria is mediated by the Donath-­ Landsteiner (D-­L) hemolysin, which is an IgG cold-­reactive autoanti- body with anti-­P specificity. In vitro, the D-­L antibody binds to RBCs in the cold, and the RBCs are lysed by complement as the temperature is increased to 37°C. A similar sequence is thought to occur in vivo as RBCs move from the cooler extremities to warmer parts of the circu- lation. Most reported cases are self-­limited; many patients experience only one paroxysm of hemolysis. Congenital or acquired syphilis was once the most common underlying cause of paroxysmal cold hemo- globinuria, but currently, most cases are associated with nonspecific viral infections. Treatment includes transfusion for severe anemia and avoidance of cold ambient temperatures. Drug-­Induced Hemolytic Anemia Drugs (penicillin or sometimes cephalosporins) that cause hemolysis through the “hapten” mechanism (immune but not autoimmune) bind tightly to the RBC membrane. Antibodies to the drug, either newly or previously formed, bind to the drug molecules on RBCs, mediating their destruction in the spleen. In other cases, certain drugs, such as quinine and quinidine, do not bind to RBCs, but rather form part of a “ternary com- plex,” consisting of the drug, an RBC membrane antigen, and an antibody that recognizes both (see Table 513.3). Methyldopa and sometimes cepha- losporins may, by unknown mechanisms, incite true autoantibodies to RBC membrane antigens, so that the presence of the drug is not required to cause hemolysis. Cephalosporins are the most common cause of drug-­ induced immune hemolytic anemia. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Red blood cell (RBC) destruction may occur in hemolytic anemias because of mechanical injury as the cells traverse a damaged vas- cular bed. Damage may be microvascular when RBCs are sheared by fibrin in the capillaries during intravascular coagulation or when renovascular disease accompanies the hemolytic-­uremic syndrome (HUS) (see Chapter 560.5) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic pur- pura (TTP) (see Chapter 533.5). Larger vessels may be involved in Kasabach-­Merritt syndrome (giant hemangioma and thrombocyto- penia; see Chapter 554) or when a replacement heart valve is poorly epithelialized. The blood film shows many schistocytes, or fragmented cells, as well as polychromatophilia, reflecting the reticulocytosis (see Fig. 507.4F in Chapter 507 on Castleman disease). Secondary iron deficiency may complicate the intravascular hemolysis because of urinary hemoglobin and hemosiderin iron loss (see Fig. 506.2 in Chapter 506). Treatment should be directed toward the underly- ing condition, and the prognosis depends on the effectiveness of this treatment. The benefit of transfusion may be transient because the transfused cells are destroyed as quickly as those produced by the patient. It is critical to determine the precise etiology of the fragmentation hemolysis because the treatment depends on the underlying problem (Table 514.1). Acquired TTP results from an antibody to an enzyme (ADAMTS13) that regulates the size of von Willebrand multimers. The lack of this enzyme results in a marked increase in multimer size and a resultant thrombotic microangiopathy. Congenital TTP can result in the inability to produce adequate amounts of the enzyme ADAMTS13 and results in the same pathophysiology. The treatment for acquired TTP involves plasma exchange (PEX) to remove the antibody and replace the ADAMTS13, in addition to immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible when there is a high index of suspicion, even before confirmation of the diagnosis because of high morbidity and mortality. Once diagno- sis has been confirmed, rituximab is suggested. Use of caplacizumab, an anti-­von Willebrand factor monoclonal antibody, is used in adult patients with severe disease, although it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in children. The treatment for congenital TTP involves scheduled plasma infusions to replace the ADAMTS13. Recombinant ADAMTS13 is under investigation for use in acquired and congenital TTP. In contrast, HUS results from Shiga toxin produced by Escherichia coli 0157 and may not be helped by plasmapheresis, and treatment is largely based on supportive mea- sures. Atypical HUS involves activation of the alternative complement pathway and can be treated with eculizumab (anti-­C5), an inhibitor of the complement pathway. Plasmapheresis may reduce the RBC frag- mentation and improve the platelet count but has little effect on the tissue (kidney) vasculopathy, and thus is not usually recommended. Pneumococcal-­induced HUS results from neuraminidase produced by the bacteria, which damages the membranes of the RBCs and the kidney, exposing the T-­antigen. Plasma contains natural antibody to the T-­antigen, producing hemolysis, renal damage, and a thrombotic microangiopathy. Thus, patients with T-­antigen activation from sus- pected pneumococcal-­induced HUS should not be given plasma infu- sions because this will significantly exacerbate the RBC hemolysis and can lead to life-­threatening anemia. THERMAL INJURY Extensive burns may directly damage the RBCs and cause hemolysis that results in the formation of spherocytes. Blood loss and marrow suppression may contribute to anemia and require blood transfusion. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been used as treatment for diminished RBC production. There may be a role of early use of propranolol, which has been shown to restore erythrocyte progenitors. Chapter 514 Hemolytic Anemias Secondary to Other Extracellular Factors Allison S.

EPO production may be decreased, and the marrow suppressed by toxic metabolites. Further- more, the RBC life span often is shortened because of retention of metab- olites and organic acidemia. The use of EPO in chronic renal disease can decrease the need for blood transfusion. Abnormalities in the hepcidin-­ ferroportin pathway provide an additional pathway contributing to anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Investigative use of med- ications targeting this pathway are being evaluated in patients. Hemodi- alysis is also implicated in causing fragmentation of erythrocytes. LIVER DISEASE A change in the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids in the plasma may result in changes in the composition of the RBC membrane and short- ening of the RBC life span. Some patients with liver disease have many target RBCs on the blood film, whereas others have a preponderance of spiculated cells. These morphologic changes reflect the alterations in the plasma lipid composition. TOXINS AND VENOMS Bacterial sepsis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, or streptococci may be complicated by accompanying hemolysis. Particu- larly severe hemolytic anemia has been observed in clostridial infec- tions and results from a hemolytic clostridial toxin. Large numbers of spherocytes may be seen on the blood film. Spherocytic hemoly- sis also may be noted after bites by various snakes, including cobras, vipers, and rattlesnakes, which have phospholipases in their venom. Large numbers of bites by insects, such as bees, wasps, and yellow jack- ets, also may cause spherocytic hemolysis by a similar mechanism (see Chapter 768). WILSON DISEASE See Chapter 405.2. An acute and self-­limited episode of hemolytic anemia may precede by years the onset of hepatic or neurologic symptoms in Wilson dis- ease. This event appears to result from the toxic effects of free copper on the RBC membrane. The blood film often (but not always) shows large numbers of spherocytes, and the Coombs test result is negative. Because early diagnosis of Wilson disease permits prophylactic treat- ment with penicillamine and prevention of hepatic and neurologic disease, correct assessment of this rare type of hemolysis is important.

Brandow Polycythemia exists when the hemoglobin concentration and/ or hematocrit and total red blood cell (RBC) volume exceed the upper limits of normal in peripheral blood. In postpubertal indi- viduals, an RBC mass >25% above the mean normal value (based on body surface area) or a hemoglobin level >16.5 g/dL (in males) or >16.0 g/dL (in females) and/or hematocrit >49% (in males) or >48% (in females) indicate absolute erythrocytosis. A decrease in plasma volume, such as occurs in acute dehydration and burns, may result in a high hemoglobin value. These situations are more accu- rately designated as hemoconcentration or relative polycythemia because the RBC mass is not increased, and normalization of the plasma volume restores hemoglobin to ­normal levels. Once the diagnosis of true polycythemia is made, sequential studies should be done to determine the underlying etiology (Fig. 515.1). CLONAL POLYCYTHEMIA (POLYCYTHEMIA VERA) Pathogenesis Polycythemia vera is an acquired clonal myeloproliferative neo- plastic disorder, which is rare in children and adolescents. The median age of diagnosis is >60 years. Although primarily manifest- ing as erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis and leukocytosis can also be seen. When isolated severe thrombocytosis exists in the absence of erythrocytosis, the myeloproliferative disorder is called essential thrombocythemia. A gain-­of-­function pathogenic variant involv- ing exon 12 or 14 (V617F) of JAK2, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, is found in >90% of adult patients with polycythemia vera, but in <30% of children with this condition. The erythropoietin receptor is normal, and serum erythropoietin levels are low. Patients with- out JAK pathogenic variants may have variants in the calreticulin or thrombopoietin receptor genes. Risk factors for development of polycythemia vera include a family history of polycythemia vera and presence of an autoimmune disorder. Clinical Manifestations Patients with polycythemia vera usually have splenomegaly. Eryth- rocytosis may cause hypertension, headache, early satiety, or neurologic symptoms and increases the risk of thrombosis. Granu- locytosis may cause diarrhea or pruritus from histamine release. Thrombocytosis (with or without platelet dysfunction) may cause thrombosis or hemorrhage. Bleeding or acquired von Willebrand disease with extreme thrombocytosis, and complications of preg- nancy may occur. Long-­term effects include progression to myelo- fibrosis, myelodysplasia, and/or acute leukemia. These events are rare in children. Table 515.1 lists the diagnostic criteria for polycy- themia vera. Treatment Phlebotomy and low-­dose aspirin are the initial treatments of choice to alleviate symptoms of hyperviscosity and decrease the risk of thrombosis. Iron supplementation should be given to prevent vis- cosity problems from iron-­deficient microcytosis or thrombocyto- sis. If these treatments are unsuccessful, the patient has progressive splenomegaly, thrombocytosis, or leukocytosis, or has high-­risk features (i.e., age >60 or history of thrombosis), antiproliferative treatments (hydroxyurea, pegylated interferon, or busulfan) may be helpful. The use of ruxolitinib (a JAK2 inhibitor) is approved in hydroxyurea-­resistant or hydroxyurea-­intolerant adult patients, but the long-­term effectiveness remains under investigation. There are limited data in the treatment of children, given the rarity of the condition. Often only phlebotomy is required. Transformation of the disease into myelofibrosis or acute leukemia is rare in children. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Chapter 517  u  Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes with Pancytopenia  2999 by augmenting hypoxia sensing or abnormalities in oxygen sens- ing. Autosomal dominant causes include hemoglobins that have increased oxygen affinity (P50 [partial pressure of oxygen in the blood at which the hemoglobin is 50% saturated] <20 mm Hg), erythropoietin receptor pathogenic variants resulting in an enhanced effect of erythropoietin, or variants in the von Hippel– Lindau (VHL), EGLN1, or EPAS1 genes that result in altered intra- cellular oxygen sensing. Another rare cause is autosomal recessive 2,3-­diphosphoglyceric acid deficiency, which leads to a left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, increased oxygen affinity, and con- sequent polycythemia. Subtle decreases in oxygen delivery to tissues may cause polycy- themia. Congenital methemoglobinemia resulting from an auto- somal recessive deficiency of cytochrome b5 reductase may cause cyanosis and polycythemia (see Chapter 511.7). Most affected indi- viduals are asymptomatic. Neurologic abnormalities may be present in patients whose enzyme deficits are not limited to hematopoietic cells. Hemoglobin M disease (autosomal dominant) causes methe- moglobinemia and can lead to polycythemia. Cyanosis may occur in the presence of as little as 1.5 g/dL of methemoglobin but is uncom- mon in other hemoglobin variants unless hyperviscosity results in localized hypoxemia. In rare cases, there is an undefined inherited lesion causing primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP), which is described as an elevation of erythrocyte mass and hemoglobin, hypersensitivity to EPO, and low serum EPO in the setting of a normal hemoglobin-­ oxygen dissociation curve. Acquired (Secondary) Polycythemia Polycythemia may be present in clinical situations associated with chronic arterial oxygen desaturation. Cardiovascular defects involv- ing right-­to-­left shunts and pulmonary diseases interfering with proper oxygenation are the most common causes of hypoxic poly- cythemia. Clinical findings usually include cyanosis, hyperemia of the sclerae and mucous membranes, and clubbing of the fingers. As the hematocrit rises to >65%, clinical manifestations of hypervis- cosity, such as headache and hypertension, may require phlebot- omy. Living at high altitudes also causes hypoxic polycythemia; the hemoglobin level increases approximately 4% for each rise of 1,000 m (∼3,300 ft) in altitude. Smoking has been associated with polycy- themia secondary to tissue hypoxia, elevation of carbon monoxide, and volume contraction. Partial obstruction of a renal artery rarely results in polycythemia. Polycythemia has also been associated with benign and malignant tumors that secrete paraneoplastic erythro- poietin. Exogenous or endogenous excess of anabolic steroids also may cause polycythemia. A common spurious cause is a decrease in plasma volume, as occurs in moderate to severe dehydration. DIAGNOSIS See Chapter 515; Figure 515.1 outlines sequential studies to evaluate polycythemia. TREATMENT For mild disease, observation is sufficient. When the hematocrit is >65–70% (hemoglobin >23 g/dL), blood viscosity greatly increases. Periodic phlebotomy may prevent or decrease symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or exertional dyspnea. Apheresed blood should be replaced with plasma or saline to prevent hypovolemia in patients accustomed to a chronically elevated total blood volume. Increased demand for red blood cell production may cause iron deficiency. Iron-­deficient microcytic red cells are more rigid, further increas- ing the risk of intracranial and other thromboses in patients with polycythemia. Periodic assessment of iron status should be per- formed, and iron deficiency should be treated. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. Chapter 517 Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes with Pancytopenia Yigal Dror and Michaela Cada Pancytopenia refers to a reduction below normal values of all three peripheral blood lineages: leukocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes. Identifying the etiology of pancytopenia usually requires microscopic examination of the peripheral blood smear, as well as bone marrow biopsy and aspirate specimens to assess overall cellularity and mor- phology. The three general categories of pancytopenia are related to bone marrow pathologies and can frequently be differentiated based on bone marrow findings. Pancytopenia with hypocellular bone marrow on biopsy is seen with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs) with pancyto- penia, acquired aplastic anemia of varied etiologies, and the hypoplastic variant of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Pancytopenia with cel- lular bone marrow is seen with primary bone marrow disease (e.g., acute leukemia, myelodysplasia) and secondary to autoimmune disor- ders (e.g., autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher, Niemann-­Pick), overwhelming infection, sarcoidosis, and hypersplenism. Pancytopenia with bone marrow infiltration can be seen in metastatic solid tumors, myelofibrosis, hemophagocytic lym- phohistiocytosis, and osteopetrosis. It is important to note that excep- tions exist with regard to this classification; IBMFSs can manifest as normocellular or hypercellular bone marrow at early stages of presen- tation or in cases where MDS develops. Inherited pancytopenias with hypocellular bone marrow are IBMFSs that feature decreased bone marrow production of the three major hematopoietic lineages occurring on an inherited basis and resulting in anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Patients may have single-­lineage or bi-­lineage cytopenia at presentation and gradu- ally develop pancytopenia over time. All disorders for which a genetic basis has been deciphered have thus far been shown to be monogenic. Transmission of pathogenic variant genes is mendelian and in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-­linked manner (Table 517.1). Modifying genes and acquired factors may also be operative. Inherited pancytopenias account for approximately 30% of cases of pediatric bone marrow failure. Clinical features may help differenti- ate the IBMFS disorders (Table 517.2), but whole exome sequencing (WES) or specific bone marrow failure syndrome gene panels help to confirm the diagnosis. FANCONI ANEMIA Etiology and Epidemiology Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare multisystem hereditary disorder result- ing in the development of bone marrow failure in those affected and a predisposition to malignancy, including myelodysplasia (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and epithelial cancers.

The estimated frequency of FA is 1 in 200,000 in most populations but is higher in Ashkenazi Jews (1:30,000) and Afrikaners (1:22,000). Carrier frequency is approximately 1:200-­300 in most populations. Pathogenic variants in 22 genes, designated FANC genes, have been reported to cause FA or FA-­like disease. All patho- genic variants except for one are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. One uncommon form of FA is X-­linked recessive. FA occurs in all ethnic groups. At presentation, patients may have typical physical anomalies and abnormal hematologic findings (majority of patients), normal physical features but abnormal hematologic findings (about one third of patients), or physical anomalies and normal hematologic findings (unknown percentage of patients). There can be sibling dis- cordance in clinical and hematologic manifestations, even in affected monozygotic twins. Pathology All FA genes code for proteins that play roles in various cellular path- ways and most prominently in DNA cross linking and repair. Patients with FA have faulty DNA repair and increased chromosomal fragil- ity caused by DNA interstrand cross-­linking agents such as diepoxy- butane (DEB) and mitomycin C (MMC). Cell fusion of FA cells with normal cells or with cells from some unrelated patients with FA pro- duces a corrective effect on chromosomal fragility, a process called complementation. The classic FA phenotype that clearly defines the FA-­associated genes (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCJ/BACH1/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCP/SLX4, FANCQ/ERCC4, UBE2T, REV7, RFWD3) includes the triad of bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies, and elevated chromosome fragility. These genes can be mutated in patients who have one or all of the compo- nents of the triad. Genes that were found to be associated with one or two but not all three of the components are FA-­like genes (FANCO/ RAD51C, RAD51, FANCS/BRCA1, FANCR/EXCC2). FANCA accounts for approximately 64% of FA cases, FANCC for 14%, and FANG for 9%. FANCB, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, and FANCF are collec- tively mutated in almost 13% of FA patients. The remaining genes are pathogenic variants in rare cases. The proteins encoded by wild-­type FANC genes are involved in the DNA damage recognition and repair biochemical pathway. Therefore aberrant proteins lead to genomic instability and chromosome fragility. FANC proteins are involved in other cellular activities, such as reactive oxygen species detoxification, energetic metabolism, and cytokine sig- naling. Thus FANC pathogenic variants likely affect several cellular and biochemical roles of the respective proteins, which eventually leads to the FA phenotype. The observed disease complexity and heterogeneity is likely caused by the involvement of multiple cellular and biochemical pathways both in unrelated individuals and in family members with the same genetic pathogenic variant. Clinical Manifestations The most common congenital anomalies in FA are skeletal and include absence of radii and/or thumbs that are hypoplastic, supernumer- ary, bifid, or absent. Anomalies of the feet, congenital hip dislocation, and leg abnormalities can also be seen (Fig. 517.1 and Table 517.3).

Chapter 517  u  Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes with Pancytopenia  3003 café-­au-­lait spots; and vitiligo, alone or in combination, occur with similar frequency. Short stature is common and in some patients is aggravated by subnormal growth hormone (GH) secretion or hypo- thyroidism. Male patients with FA may have an underdeveloped penis; undescended, atrophic, or absent testes; and hypospadias or phimosis, and all are infertile. Females can have malformations of the vagina, uterus, and ovary, and all have reduced fertility. Many patients have characteristic facial dysmorphisms, including microcephaly, small eyes, epicanthal folds, and abnormal shape, size, or positioning of the ears (see Fig. 517.1). Kidneys may be ectopic, pelvic, horseshoe-­ shaped, hypoplastic, dysplastic, or absent. Cardiovascular (CV) and gastrointestinal (GI) malformations also occur. Approximately 10% of patients with FA are cognitively delayed. Neonates with FA usually have intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birthweight and may show malformations consistent with VACTERL/VACTERL-­H association (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac malformations, tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, renal and limb struc- tural abnormalities with hydrocephalus). Bone marrow failure usually appears within the first decade of life. Thrombocytopenia, red blood cell (RBC) macrocytosis, and increased fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), as a result of bone marrow stress, often appear first. At these stages, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy often show a hypo- cellular specimen. Subsequently, patients develop neutropenia and then anemia. Severe aplasia develops in most cases, usually over a few years. Cancer Risk and Other Complications In addition to the low blood counts and physical anomalies, patients with FA have a high risk of developing cancer. The most frequent solid tumors are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the head and neck (600-­ fold higher risk than the general population) and carcinoma of the upper esophagus (2,000-­fold higher risk), the vulva (3,000-­fold higher risk), and/or anus, cervix, and lower esophagus. Onset of solid-­tumor malignancy is much sooner than that seen in the general population, with median age of onset of SCC in the FA population occurring at 33 years vs 60–70 years in the general population. Human papillo- mavirus (HPV) is suspected in the pathogenesis of SCC. Benign and malignant liver tumors can occur (adenomas, hepatomas) and are usually associated with androgen therapy for aplastic anemia. Andro- gens are also implicated in the etiology of peliosis hepatis (blood-­ filled hepatic sinusoids), which is reversible when androgen therapy is discontinued. Clonal bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities are common in FA and on follow-­up can either be stable, intermittently detected, or progressive. The cumulative incidence of clonal and malignant myeloid transformation by age 18 years, which includes clonal cytogenetic marrow abnormalities, MDS, and AML, is approxi- mately 75%. One study indicated that by age 40 years, the cumulative incidence of leukemia is 33%. Diagnosis FA should be considered in all children and young adults with unex- plained cytopenias. Abnormal hematologic findings and characteris- tic physical anomalies suggest the diagnosis, which can be confirmed with a lymphocyte chromosomal breakage study done with and without the addition of cross-­linking agents such as DEB and MMC. Increased chromosome fragility is indicated by spontaneously occur- ring chromatid breaks, rearrangements, gaps, endoreduplications, and chromatid exchanges in blood lymphocytes cultured with phytohe- magglutinin, as well as in cultured skin fibroblasts, underscoring the constitutional nature of FA. With the addition of DEB or MMC, fra- gility is strikingly enhanced in lymphocyte cultures of patients with FA compared with those of controls. Abnormal chromosome breakage analysis and genetic testing for prenatal diagnosis can be performed on amniotic fluid cells or on tissue from a chorionic villus biopsy. No other inherited pancytopenia is associated with a prominent in vitro hyper- sensitivity to DEB or MMC by the chromosomal breakage study. How- ever, 10–15% of patients with suspected FA have somatic mosaicism and may not show the characteristically high degree of chromosomal fragility in their lymphocytes, reflecting the presence of mixed popula- tions of somatic cells, some with two abnormal alleles and some with only one. The latter population of lymphocytes derives from a por- tion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that underwent spontaneous somatic gene correction on one allele. Testing of skin fibroblasts should be performed if the suspicion of FA is high despite negative testing on peripheral blood lymphocytes. Next-­generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels and WES are the tests of choice for FA. NGS is an efficient and accurate method for diagnosing FA but can occasionally be limited by difficulties in inter- preting previously unreported variants or in unraveling pathogenic variants due to reversion variants or technical matters. When no defi- nite causative point pathogenic variants are found, high-­resolution copy number variation analysis techniques are employed, followed by a genome-­wide search for pathogenic variants in novel associated genes. Pathogenic variants in one of the 22 FA genes are found in over 95% of FA cases. Extensive screening for potential medical problems is necessary after the diagnosis of FA is established. Imaging using radiation should be minimized as much as possible because of the carcinogenic risk inher- ent to this genetic instability disease; MRI should replace CT whenever possible. In addition to detailed review of the past medical history and thorough physical examination, the screen should include ultrasono- graphic examination of the abdomen and echocardiography to rule out internal congenital anomalies. Other imaging may be done as nec- essary and based on the initial screen. Subspecialty consultations for anomalies and disabilities that have been identified can be arranged during this interval. If growth velocity is below expectations, endocrine evaluation is needed to assess for GH and thyroid deficiency. Blood work should include evaluation of renal, liver, thyroid, metabolic, and immune systems. Treatment A hematologist, preferably one who specializes in IBMFSs, with a mul- tidisciplinary team should manage patients with FA. At diagnosis, a detailed assessment of the patient’s blood counts, bone marrow func- tion, growth, development, and other organ function should be carried out. If hematologic abnormalities are mild to moderate and stable and there is no transfusion requirement, patients can be observed closely with peripheral blood counts every 3 months and bone marrow aspira- tion surveillance every year for clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS, and AML. Bone marrow biopsy might also be intermittently done during bone marrow testing to evaluate changes in percentage of cel- lularity and fibrosis. More frequent monitoring can be applied when deemed necessary, as when a decline in blood counts occurs. Glucose levels should be performed annually or biannually, depending on the degree of hyperglycemia found on initial testing. Screening for hypo- thyroidism should be performed yearly. Patients should be assessed for solid tumors at least annually, with a careful physical examination that includes comprehensive inspection of the skin, oral cavity, and other organs for unusual masses. After a certain age (e.g., 10 years) or after HSC transplant (HSCT), fluoroscopic examination of the orolaryngeal cavity and occult fecal blood testing are also recommended. Beginning at menarche, female patients should be screened annually for gyneco- logic cancer. Administration of HPV quadrivalent vaccine to decrease the risk of SCC is advised. Chromosome fragility (and/or targeted genetic testing) should be offered to siblings and parents of affected patients for identification of other affected individuals. It is noteworthy that heterozygosity for sev- eral FA genes (e.g., FANCN, FANCD1, FANCS) is associated with cancer development. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of patients, bio- logical parents, and full siblings for future HSCT should also occur early. HSCT is the only curative therapy for the hematologic abnormalities observed in FA patients. Outcomes have improved because of modified reduced-­intensity regimens that include fludarabine, low dose cyclo- phosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin with or without low-­dose busulfan. Most regimens do not use radiation. These regimens have decreased the toxicities experienced by FA patients, who have high sensitivity to DNA-­damaging agents such as alkylating drugs and irra- diation.

All rights reserved. 3004  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood donor without irradiation in the preparative regimen have an overall 3-­5-­year survival rate of >90%. Traditionally, HSCT of FA patients with matched unrelated donors (MUD) or mismatched related donors have been a challenge because of the high degree of HSCT-­related toxicity and death. However, major progress has been made in this regard. Several reports of radiation-­ free HSCT with in vivo or ex-­vivo T-­cell depleted, peripheral blood CD34+ selected MUD graft and conditioning with fludarabine, rab- bit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), low-­dose cyclophosphamide, and low-­dose busulfan demonstrated 80% or higher probabilities of overall and disease-­free survival 1–­5 years post HSCT. Improve- ment in high-­resolution HLA typing contributes to better selection of unrelated-­donor selection and a better outcome. Transplantation using haploidentical donors is on the rise and is showing promising outcomes, similar to those seen with unrelated donors. Those transplanted before they receive multiple transfusions or develop clonal and malignant myeloid transformation (MDS or AML) do better. Survival rates are higher for patients who undergo transplant at <10 years of age. Molecular technology has led to preimplantation genetic diagnosis on parent-­derived blastomeres, allowing for the unaf- fected ones to be implanted and resulting in the creation of an HLA-­ matched sibling donor without FA. Androgens produce a response in approximately 70% of patients, her- alded by reticulocytosis and a rise in hemoglobin within 1-­2 months. White blood cell (WBC) counts may increase next, followed by plate- let counts. After the initial response is seen, counts may continue to improve over many months until a maximum response is achieved. If a low dose is initially employed, the androgen dose can be increased every 3-­4 weeks as long as no major side effects are seen and until the desired response is achieved. If a high dose is initially employed, androgen dosage can be slowly reduced to the minimum dose that maintains the required blood counts. Oral danazol and oxymetholone are currently the two most commonly used androgenic drugs. Patients typically stop responding to androgens after several months or years, as their bone marrow failure progresses or as they develop MDS or AML. Thus androgen therapy is not curative but is used rather as a bridge while waiting for a suitable donor for HSCT or while weighing the risks and benefits of transplant. Side effects of androgens include masculinization, increased linear growth, increased mood swings or aggressiveness, elevated hepatic enzymes, cholestasis, peliosis hepatis, and liver tumors. Screenings for these should be performed regularly. The potential for recombinant growth factor (cytokine) therapy for FA has not been defined. Granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor (G-­ CSF) can usually induce an increase in the absolute neutrophil count; however, there may be a heightened risk of expansion of bone marrow cells with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities such as monosomy 7. In one study, combination therapy consisting of G-­CSF given subcutaneously daily or every 2 days along with erythropoietin given subcutaneously or intravenously 3 times per week resulted in improved neutrophil counts in most patients and a sustained rise in hemoglobin and plate- let levels in approximately one third of patients. Most patients lost the response because of progression of bone marrow disease. Prognosis Improvements in supportive care, careful surveillance of known com- plications, prompt intervention, and improved transplant techniques have resulted in patients with FA surviving into their 30s. Unfortu- nately, there is an increased risk of solid tumors after HSCT. For exam- ple, head and neck cancer risk is increased 4.4-­fold and is accelerated by approximately 15 years compared with nontransplanted patients. The cumulative incidence of malignancy 20 years after transplant is 35–40%. Some of the increased risk might be attributed to the use of DNA-­damaging agents or the occurrence of graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD). SHWACHMAN-­DIAMOND SYNDROME Etiology and Epidemiology Shwachman-­Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an inherited disorder caused by pathogenic variants in one of four genes. It occurs in all racial and ethnic groups. SDS is a multisystem disorder. However, the nonhema- tologic manifestations of SDS are substantially different and usually include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and skeletal abnormalities such as metaphyseal dysplasia (Table 517.4). SDS is a ribosomopathy, and the underlying defect is in ribosome assembly. Pathology Four genes have been linked to SDS. SBDS is the first gene that was described to have biallelic variants in SDS in 2003. SBDS maps to chromosome 7q11 and accounts for 80–90% of SDS cases. SBDS plays a role in the late stage of the pre-­60S ribosome subunit maturation, binding to the EFL1 GTPase and facilitating the release of eIF6 to enable 80S monosome formation. DNAJC21 is the second reported SDS gene. The function of the human DNAJC21 is required for the release and recycling of the Arx1/Alb1 heterodimer from the pre-­60S biogenesis factors. The third SDS gene discovered is EFL1. DNAJC21 and EFL1-­associated SDS are autosomal recessive. Monoallelic patho- genic variants in SRP54, a protein involved in co-­translational protein modification, mainly cause severe congenital neutropenia phenotype. Nevertheless, a small proportion of the patients have partial or classical SDS phenotype. The underlying genetic defects of SDS indicate that the last step in ribosome biogenesis is associated with pancytopenia (most often neutropenia) and a hypoplastic bone marrow. Defects in ribo- somal proteins that are involved in earlier stages of ribosome subunit maturation and are structural components of the ribosome are associ- ated with predominantly anemia and pure red cell aplasia. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is caused by failure of exocrine pancreatic acinar development in SDS, and fatty replacement of pan- creatic tissue is prominent. Bone marrow failure is characterized by dysfunctional HSCs, accelerated apoptosis of bone marrow progeni- tors, and a defective bone marrow microenvironment that does not support and maintain normal hematopoiesis. Clinical Manifestations Most patients with SDS have symptoms of fat malabsorption from birth that are caused by pancreatic insufficiency, but steatorrhea is not always obvious. Approximately 50% of patients appear to exhibit an improvement in pancreatic enzyme secretion as they age. The clinical picture can be dominated by complications from neutropenia, anemia, Table 517.4     Major Clinical Features of Shwachman-­ Diamond Syndrome CLINICAL FEATURE TOTAL/AVERAGE Number of patients 225 Neutropenia 90% Severe (≤500/μL) 46% Anemia 46% Thrombocytopenia 42% Pancytopenia 21% Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 98% Liver (elevated transaminases) 61% Skeletal abnormalities 70% Metaphyseal dysostosis 53% Rib cage abnormalities 35% Short stature (<3rd percentile) 66% Data from Ginzberg H, Shin J, Ellis L, et al.

Bacterial and fungal infections secondary to neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and immunodeficiency can occur. A major concern is the development of MDS and acute leuke- mia, most often AML. Short stature is a consistent feature of SDS. Most patients show nor- mal growth velocity yet remain consistently below the 3rd percentile for height and weight. The occasional SDS adult achieves the 25th per- centile for height. Although skeletal abnormalities are variable, classic findings are metaphyseal dysplasia, osteopenia, delayed appearance of secondary ossification centers, short or flared ribs, and thoracic dystrophy. Some patients have hepatomegaly and elevations of liver enzymes. Most patients have dental abnormalities and poor oral health. Many have neurocognitive problems and poor social skills. Laboratory Findings Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in SDS is associated with reduced age-­adjusted serum trypsinogen and pancreatic isoamylase levels. Because serum pancreatic isoamylase is physiologically low in the first 3 years of life, and because reduced serum trypsinogen is typically seen in young infants and often improves with age, testing both enzymes is helpful. Fecal elastase is often reduced in SDS patients. Fat-­soluble vita- min (A, D, E, and K) absorption is impaired, and thus measurement of vitamin A, D, and E levels, as well as prothrombin time (or interna- tional normalized ratio [INR]), is helpful to assess the consequences of fat malabsorption. Ultrasound or CT scan can visualize fatty replace- ment of pancreatic tissue. Fat malabsorption can be proven by assay on a 72-­hour stool collection. Neutropenia is observed in about 70% of patients with SDS at pre- sentation and is seen in close to 100% of patients on follow-­up. It is chronic but can be persistent or intermittent and mild, moderate, or severe. It has been identified in some neonates during an episode of sepsis. Neutrophils may have a defect in mobility, migration, and che- motaxis because of alterations in neutrophil cytoskeletal or microtubu- lar function. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia are seen in 40–66%, 40–60%, and 21–44% of cases, respectively. Pancytopenia can be severe as a result of full-­blown aplastic anemia. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens show varying degrees of bone mar- row hypoplasia and fat infiltration. However, at a young age or when patients develop MDS or leukemia, the bone marrow can be normocel- lular or even hypercellular. Patients may also have B-­cell defects with one or more of the follow- ing: low immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgG subclasses, low percentage of circulating B lymphocytes, decreased in vitro B-­cell proliferation, and lack of specific antibody production. Patients may have a low percent- age of circulating T cells, subsets, or natural killer cells and decreased in vitro T-­cell proliferation. Diagnosis The clinical diagnosis of SDS relies on having evidence of two of the following: bone marrow dysfunction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and metaphyseal dysplasia. However, atypical presentations have been identified, such as MDS without previous documentation of low blood counts. Up to 20% of patients lack clear evidence of exocrine pancreatic defects at diagnosis. Furthermore, 20–60% lack metaphyseal dyspla- sia at diagnosis because this bony anomaly often develops with age. Therefore it is recommended that all patients with either hypoplastic/ aplastic bone marrow or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or metaphy- seal dysplasia of unknown etiology be considered for SDS genetic test- ing. Genetic analysis for SBDS, DNAJC21, and EFL1 are definitive in all or almost all cases of SDS. A patient with neutropenia and an SRP54 pathogenic variant who does not have exocrine pancreatic insuffi- ciency or metaphyseal dysplasia should be considered as having severe congenital neutropenia. Pearson syndrome, consisting of refractory sideroblastic ane- mia, cytoplasmic vacuolization of bone marrow precursors, meta- bolic acidosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and a diagnostic mitochondrial DNA pathogenic variant, is similar to SDS, but the clinical course, morphologic features of the bone marrow, and gene pathogenic variant are different. Severe anemia requiring transfusion, rather than neutropenia, is present in Pearson syndrome from birth to 1 year of age. SDS shares some manifestations with Fanconi anemia, such as bone marrow dysfunction and growth failure, but patients with SDS are readily distinguished because of pancreatic insufficiency with fat malabsorption, fatty changes within the pancreatic body visu- alized by imaging, characteristic skeletal abnormalities not seen in FA, and a normal chromosomal breakage study with DEB and MMC. Distinguishing SDS from dyskeratosis congenita (DC) may not be possible based solely on clinical findings and pancreatic enzyme lev- els; telomere length measurement may facilitate a correct diagnosis. In difficult cases of IBMFSs that cannot be easily classified, comprehensive genetic testing using an NGS panel of all known IBMFS genes or unbi- ased testing using WES/genome sequencing is likely to assist in establish- ing a diagnosis. Predisposition to Cancer Patients with SDS are predisposed to MDS and leukemic transforma- tion. Approximately 25% of patients develop clonal marrow cytoge- netic abnormalities, MDS, or leukemia by age 18 years. About one third of patients have been reported to develop leukemia by age 30 years. Isochromosome 7q [i(7q)] is particularly common and is rarely seen in other conditions. i(7q) might be related to the presence of patho- genic variant SBDS on 7q11 and likely confers a compensatory effect by increasing SBDS transcribing alleles (although they remain variant). Other clonal chromosome abnormalities include monosomy 7, i(7q) combined with monosomy 7, deletions or translocations involving part of 7q, and deletions of 20q [Del(20q)]. The i(7q) and del(20q) are asso- ciated with relatively low risk and very slow progression to MDS or leukemic transformation. Treatment Fat malabsorption responds to oral pancreatic enzyme replacement and supplemental fat-­soluble vitamins, administered according to guidelines similar to those for cystic fibrosis. A long-­term plan should be initiated to periodically monitor changes in peripheral blood counts that require corrective action and to look for early evidence of malignant myeloid transformation. The latter also requires periodic bone marrow aspirations for smears and cytogenetic testing, as well as bone marrow biopsy. A common recommendation is to perform bone marrow testing every 1-­3 years and complete blood counts every 3 months. Daily subcutaneous G-­CSF for profound neutropenia is effective in inducing a sustained increase in neutrophils. Some patients require transfusion support for management of severe anemia or thrombo- cytopenia. Experience with erythropoietin is limited. Androgens have been used in few published cases (with and without steroids); some patients showed response, and some did not. The only curative option for severe bone marrow failure and advanced MDS or leukemia in SDS is allogeneic HSCT. Traditional myeloablative HSCT results in treatment-­related mortality in 35–50% of patients. Reduced-­intensity conditioning regimens that incorpo- rate fludarabine appear to be safer and have been shown to be effec- tive in SDS. Graft failure poses a challenge, possibly due to a stromal cell defect that is not corrected by HSCT. Results of treatment for advanced MDS and AML are generally limited, and outcome is typi- cally poor. Prognosis The accurate life expectancy of SDS patients is unknown; analysis of published cases revealed a median survival of 35 years. Because the number of undiagnosed patients with mild or asymptomatic dis- ease is unknown, the overall prognosis may be better than previously thought. Although all patients have some degree of hematologic cytopenia at diagnosis, the changes in most patients are mild to moderate and do not require therapeutic intervention. Severe neutropenia responds well to G-­CSF, but there is a concern that G-­CSF may promote the growth of evolving MDS or leukemia clones because of the agent’s powerful Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

HSCT for severe bone marrow failure has produced a 50–70% survival rate, but safer protocols need to be introduced. Malignant bone marrow transformation remains ominous. Approximately 50% of patients experience spontaneous conversion from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to pancreatic sufficiency as a result of improvement in pancreatic enzyme secretion. DYSKERATOSIS CONGENITA Etiology and Epidemiology DC is an inherited multisystem telomere disorder. A diagnostic triad of mucocutaneous features was proposed when the disorder was first described and included dysplastic nails, lacy reticular pigmentation of the upper chest and/or neck, and oral leukoplakia (Fig. 517.2). However, this triad is not present in all individuals. If it occurs, skin and nail findings usually become apparent in the first 10 years of life, whereas oral leukoplakia may be noticed later. Manifestations tend to progress as patients age. Hematological manifestations are actually the most common features in this disease. Varying degrees of bone mar- row failure are seen in approximately 90% of patients. Severe aplastic anemia occurs in approximately 50% of cases, with the age of onset varying according to the genetic group. In some genetic groups, the disease usually starts in the first decade of life (e.g., DKC1, TINF2, PARN), whereas in others, it typically starts after the first decade (e.g., TERT, TERC). In addition to progressive bone marrow failure, patients with DC are also at high risk for pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, other congenital anomalies, and a predisposition to solid tumors and MDS or AML. DC is rare, with an incidence in childhood of approximately 4 cases per 1 million population per year. Pathology DC is genetically heterogeneous, and patients have pathogenic vari- ants in genes that encode components of the telomerase complex (TERT, TERC), telomere-­capping complex (CTC1, STN1), T-­loop unwinding and telomere replication (RTEL1, RPA1), telomerase trafficking (WRAP53/TCAB1), TERC-­associated factors that stim- ulate telomerase activity (DKC1, NOP10, NHP2, NAF1), TERC-­ maturation factors (PARN), and telomere-­shelterin complex (TINF2, POT1, ACD). All components are critical for telomere maintenance. The X-­linked recessive form of DC maps to Xq28, and many pathogenic variants have been identified in the DKC1 gene, which codes for the nuclear protein dyskerin. The autosomal dominant form of disease is caused by pathogenic variants in TINF2, TERC, TERT, RTEL1, ACD, NAF1, and RPA1. Autosomal recessive DC is linked to pathogenic vari- ants in NOP10, NHP2, TCAB1/WRAP53, CTC1, and STN1, as well as TERT, TERC, RTEL1, PARN, and ACD. Because of impaired telo- mere maintenance in all three inherited forms of DC, extremely short telomeres (<1st percentile for age) are demonstrated in the peripheral blood cells of all patients. Finding extremely short telomeres in lym- phocytes performed by automated multicolor flow fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has 97% sensitivity and 91% specificity for DC. Approximately 70% of individuals who meet clinical diagnostic criteria of DC have a pathogenic variant in one of the known DC-­related genes. Pathogenic variants in DKC1 are most common (20–25% of individu- als), followed by TINF2 (12–20% of individuals), TERC (5–10% of individuals), RTEL1, TERT, and CTC1. The remainder of the genetic pathogenic variants have been described in only a few families. Bone marrow failure is likely caused by progressive attrition and depletion of HSCs because of premature senescence, apoptosis, or chromosome instability, which manifests as pancytopenia. Clinical Manifestations The clinical criteria for classic DC include the presence of at least two of the four major features—abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dys- trophy, leukoplakia, and bone marrow failure—and two or more of the other somatic features known to occur in DC. However, making a diagnosis continues to be challenging because individuals develop clinical features of DC at variable rates and ages, even within the same family. Further, some of the patients have only one complication (e.g., isolated bone marrow failure or isolated pulmonary fibrosis). In about one quarter of individuals with DC, pathogenic variants in the known DC-­related genes cannot be identified. The spectrum ranges from indi- viduals who develop bone marrow failure first, then years later develop other classic findings such as nail abnormalities, to others who have severe nail problems and abnormalities of skin pigmentation at pre- sentation but normal bone marrow function. In classic disease, skin pigmentation and nail changes typically appear first, usually in the first decade of life. Bone marrow failure usually develops within the first two decades, with 80% of patients developing bone marrow failure by age 30 years and almost 90% of patients having bone marrow failure at some point in their life. Lacy reticulated skin pigmentation affecting the face, neck, chest, and arms is a common finding (89%). The degree of pigmentation increases with age and can involve the entire skin surface. There may also be a telangiectatic erythematous component. Nail dystrophy of both hands and feet is the next most common finding (88%). It usually starts with longitudinal ridging, splitting, or pterygium formation and may progress to complete nail loss. Leukoplakia usually involves the oral mucosa (78%), especially the tongue, but may also be seen in the conjunctiva and the anal, urethral, or genital mucosa. Excessive tear- ing (epiphora) secondary to nasolacrimal duct obstruction is com- mon and observed in about 30% of individuals. Approximately 25% of individuals have learning difficulties and/or developmental delay. Hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles, hair loss and graying, dental car- ies or loss, esophageal stricture, pulmonary disease with reduced dif- fusion capacity and/or a restrictive defect due to pulmonary fibrosis and abnormalities in pulmonary vasculature, and short stature are each seen in approximately 15–20% of individuals.

Chapter 517  u  Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes with Pancytopenia  3007 Ocular abnormalities include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, loss of eye- lashes, strabismus, cataracts, and optic atrophy. Skeletal abnormali- ties include osteoporosis, avascular necrosis of the hips or shoulders, abnormal bone trabeculation, scoliosis, and mandibular hypoplasia. Genitourinary abnormalities include hypoplastic testes, hypospadias, phimosis, urethral stenosis, and horseshoe kidney. GI findings, such as vascular lesions causing bleeding, hepatomegaly, peptic ulceration, and fibrosis, are seen in 10% of cases. Laboratory Findings The initial hematologic change in DC is usually thrombocytopenia, anemia, or both, followed by pancytopenia and aplastic anemia. The red cells are often macrocytic, and the Hb F is elevated. Initial bone marrow specimens may be normocellular or hypercellular, but with time, a symmetric depletion of all hematopoietic lineages ensues. Some patients have immunologic abnormalities, including reduced or elevated immunoglobulin values, decreased B-­ and/or T-­lymphocyte counts, and reduction or absence of lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin. This is particularly common and severe in the DKC1-­associated disease. Primary skin fibroblasts in culture have abnormal morphologic features and doubling rate and show numer- ous unbalanced chromosome rearrangements, such as dicentrics, tri- centrics, and translocations, in the absence of DEB or MMC. These findings provide evidence of a defect that predisposes patient cells to chromosomal rearrangements and possibly to DNA damage. The hallmark of DC is very short telomeres, below the first percentile for age. However, some patients do not have short telomeres. Further, adult patients tend to have telomere length at the low range of normal rather than below the first percentile. Diagnosis The diagnosis of DC can often be made based on medical and family history and physical examination. The following abnormalities are seen in patients with DC but not in those with FA: nail dystrophy, early-­ onset leukoplakia, tooth abnormalities, hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles, and hair loss. There are several relatively more severe forms of DC. Hoyeraal-­Hreidarsson syndrome is a multisystem disorder that presents in early childhood, which requires the features of DC along with cerebellar hypoplasia to establish the diagnosis. Patients have the classic diagnostic DC triad, in addition to developmental delay, IUGR, and bone marrow failure. Hoyeraal-­Hreidarsson syndrome is genetically heterogeneous and caused by X-­linked recessive patho- genic variants in DKC1. Some patients may also have severe immu- nodeficiency. Revesz syndrome has many of the features of DC and presents in early childhood. Bilateral exudative retinopathy is required to establish a diagnosis. Patients may also have intracranial calcifica- tions, IUGR, developmental delay, and bone marrow failure. Patho- genic variants of TINF2 are involved in Revesz syndrome, making it mostly an autosomal dominant condition, but a few patients have been described without an identified pathogenic variant. Individuals with these severe forms of DC have even shorter telomere lengths than those with classic DC. Coats plus syndrome is caused by compound hetero- zygous pathogenic variants in the CTC1 gene or the STN1 gene and has overlapping features with DC, including sparse and graying hair, dystrophic nails, and anemia. Telomeres can be very short, but patients display variable telomere length. Coats plus syndrome is characterized by retinal telangiectasia and exudates, intracranial calcification, leuko- dystrophy, brain cysts, osteopenia, GI bleeding, and portal hyperten- sion caused by the development of vasculature ectasias in the stomach, small intestine, and liver. Laboratory testing and imaging are an important part in establishing a diagnosis but also evaluate the spectrum of patient organ involve- ment. These tests include, but are not limited to, the laboratory tests described in the section “Laboratory Findings,” as well as ultrasound of the abdomen, pulmonary function tests, liver enzymes, and nutritional elements (such as ferritin, folic acid, and vitamin B12). MRI of the head is useful when the patient has developmental delay and ataxia. Baseline bone marrow testing is critical. Annual evaluation of the bone marrow and complete blood counts every 3 months are common practice. Because of genomic instability, imaging involving radiation should be limited to those that may affect management. Cancer Risk and Other Complications Patients with DC are predisposed to MDS and AML, as well as to solid tumors. Cancer usually develops in the third and fourth decades of life. The cumulative incidence of solid cancers and leukemia by the age of 65–70 years were estimated as 20% and 5–10%, respectively. The cumu- lative incidence of MDS was predicted to be 20% by the age of 50 years. The actuarial risk of clonal and malignant myeloid disease is 25% by age 18 years. Forty percent of the cancers in such patients are SCCs of the head and neck (tongue, mouth, pharynx). SCCs of the skin and GI tract (esophagus, stomach, colon), as well as anorectal adenocarcinoma, are common. Patients may develop multiple separate primaries in different sites involving the tongue and nasopharynx. Other life-­threatening complications include pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and severe GI bleeding. Treatment Androgens can induce improvement of bone marrow function in approximately 70% of patients, and in some, this treatment can result in normal trilineage blood counts for a number of years. Patients with DC become refractory to androgens as aplastic anemia progresses due to HSC depletion. They also tend to be more sensitive to the side effects of androgens than FA patients, making it important to start with lower doses and to monitor for side effects frequently. When the response is maximal, the androgen dose can be slowly reduced to the minimum dose required to maintain desired and safe blood cell counts but can- not be stopped. Cytokine therapy with granulocyte-­macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-­CSF) or with G-­CSF alone or combined with erythropoi- etin appears to offer potential benefit, at least in the short term. Use of cytokines needs to be balanced with a potential growth-­promoting effect of these medications on as-­yet undetected MDS or AML cells. Allogeneic HSCT is the only curative option for severe bone marrow failure, MDS, and AML. Long-­term survival, even with sibling HLA-­ matched HSC donors, has traditionally been poor at about 50%. Mor- bidity and mortality result from transplant-­related complications such as graft failure, GVHD, sepsis, or venoocclusive disease or from emer- gence of DC-­related complications, such as pulmonary fibrosis and GI bleeding related to vascular anomalies. The high morbidity and mor- tality rate after HSCT is likely caused by ongoing tissue sensitivity and aging because of the telomere maintenance defect. Prognosis Considerable heterogeneity exists in DC, and some data about genotype-­phenotype correlations are available. Patients with certain genetic groups (e.g., monoallelic TERC, TERT) may develop severe aplastic anemia or fibrosis of the liver and lungs, but these compli- cations may appear later on in life and may not be accompanied by multisystem involvement. Patients with other genetic groups (e.g., monoallelic pathogenic variants in DKC1 or TINF2 and biallelic patho- genic variants in PARN, ACD, RTEL1, TERC or TERT) appear to have more physical anomalies and a higher incidence and earlier onset of aplastic anemia and cancer. The mean age of death for patients with DC who are diagnosed in childhood is approximately 30 years. How- ever, patients who are diagnosed during adulthood may have a mild disease or be completely asymptomatic. The main causes of death are bone marrow failure, complications of HSCT, cancer, fatal pulmonary problems, and GI bleeding. CONGENITAL AMEGAKARYOCYTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIA Etiology and Epidemiology Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is less com- mon than FA, SDS, and DC. It is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner. CAMT typically manifests in infancy as isolated thrombocyto- penia caused by reduction or absence of bone marrow megakaryocytes Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

All rights reserved. 3008  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood with initial preservation of granulopoietic and erythroid lineages. Pancytopenia due to aplastic anemia often ensues in the first few years of life. Development of MDS and AML was reported in patients with CAMT, as well as persistent aplastic anemia. The defect in CAMT is directly related to pathogenic variants in MPL, the gene for the receptor of thrombopoietin (THPO). THPO is a growth factor that promotes HSC survival and stimulates megakaryo- cyte proliferation and maturation. Heterozygotes of the pathogenic variant gene have normal hematology, whereas affected individuals have pathogenic variants in both alleles. Genotype-­phenotype correla- tions predict disease course and prognosis. Nonsense pathogenic vari- ants cause a complete loss of function of the THPO receptor, resulting in persistently low platelet counts in early infancy due to absence of megakaryocytes and a fast progression to pancytopenia and aplastic anemia (CAMT type I). Impaired stem cell survival with MPL non- sense pathogenic variants explains the evolution of CAMT into aplas- tic anemia because THPO also has an antiapoptotic and cell survival effect on HSCs. Missense pathogenic variants of MPL are associated with a milder disease course, a later presentation, a partial and tran- sient increase in platelets during the first year of life after presenta- tion, and a delayed onset, if any, of pancytopenia, indicating residual receptor function (CAMT type II). Biologically active plasma THPO is consistently elevated in all patients with CAMT. A small proportion of patients with the clinical picture of CAMT have no pathogenic vari- ants in MPL, but more recently have been found to have homozygous pathogenic variants in THPO. Clinical Manifestations Intracranial hemorrhage is a major risk; about 25% of the patients develop this complication either in utero (13%), at birth (4%), or within the first 4 weeks of life (7%). Patients with CAMT commonly have a petechial rash, bruising, or bleeding. Onset of symptoms may depend on the severity of pathogenic variants and ranges from birth to the first year of life. Most patients with CAMT have normal physical and imaging features. About 10–20% of published phenotypic CAMT cases involved physical anomalies. The most common anomalies are neurologic. Find- ings related to cerebellar and cerebral atrophy are frequent, and develop- mental delay is a prominent feature. Congenital heart disease is rare but includes atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, and coarctation of the aorta. Some of these occur in combinations. Other anomalies include abnormal hips or feet, kidney malformations, eye anomalies, and cleft or high-­arched palate. Some patients have microcephaly and abnormal facies. Laboratory Findings Thrombocytopenia is the major laboratory finding in CAMT. At birth, most patients present with thrombocytopenia but not all. Typically, at first, thrombocytopenia appears with normal hemoglobin levels and WBC counts. Peripheral blood platelets are reduced or totally absent. As in other IBMFSs, RBCs may be macrocytic. Hemoglobin F may be elevated, and there may be increased expression of i antigen. Ini- tial bone marrow aspirates and biopsy specimens show normal cel- lularity with marked reduction or absence of megakaryocytes. Most patients develop pancytopenia between 6 months to 2 years of age. In patients in whom aplastic anemia develops, bone marrow cellularity is decreased, with fatty replacement; erythropoietic and granulopoietic lineages are also symmetrically reduced. Diagnosis If thrombocytopenia persists beyond the neonatal period or is associ- ated with adequate platelet transfusion response and no obvious pre- cipitating cause such as infections or immunologic reactions, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are indicated. Deficient megakaryocytes in such cases suggest the diagnosis, and genetic analysis will confirm it. If CAMT occurs at birth or shortly after, it must be distinguished from other causes of inherited and acquired neonatal thrombocytope- nia. Thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR syndrome) is distin- guished from CAMT because radii are absent in TAR. The distinction from DC may be evident by a lack of mucocutaneous, neurologic, and immunologic findings that are characteristic of the early-­onset forms of DC. Telomere lengths below the first percentile matched for age to healthy controls is characteristic of DC and not CAMT. CAMT blood lymphocytes do not show increased chromosomal breakage when exposed to DEB, distinguishing the disease from FA. Cancer Predisposition CAMT can evolve into MDS and AML, but the true risk cannot be defined because most patients undergo early transplantation. Typical course in patients with transformation includes thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, followed by MDS (e.g., with monosomy 7 or trisomy 8) and leukemia. Therapy and Prognosis The mortality rate from thrombocytopenic bleeding, complications of aplastic anemia, or leukemic transformation in patients with MPL non- sense pathogenic variants is close to 100% if bone marrow function is not improved. Patients with missense pathogenic variants have a milder course but may still have serious complications. HSCT is the only cura- tive option. The majority of patients with CAMT who undergo HSCT are cured, especially if the procedure is performed with HLA-­matched sib- ling donors. Before transplantation, platelet transfusion should be used carefully. Platelet count should not always be the sole indication for treat- ment, but symptoms such as clinical bleeding are an appropriate trigger. Single-­donor, leuko-­reduced platelets are preferred to minimize sensi- tization. In a patient who is a candidate for HSCT, all blood products should be irradiated and cytomegalovirus safe. The role of thrombomi- metic agents such as eltrombopag or romiplostim might be suitable for some patients (CAMT type II) and need to be studied further. However, the promotion of fibrosis by these agents and the risk of MDS and leu- kemia in CAMT render HSCT the preferred treatment for patients with severe cytopenia. Romiplostim has shown good and sustained response in those with pathogenic variants in THPO, and there have been no reports of acute leukemia or MDS in this subgroup of CMPL patients, but the numbers of patients with pathogenic variants in THPO are small. GATA2-­RELATED DISORDERS The GATA2 gene codes for a hematopoietic transcription factor that is crucial for the proliferation and maintenance of early hematopoietic cells. Heterozygous germline pathogenic variants, inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and that are spontaneous in the majority of cases, result in various phenotypes that range from mild cytopenia to severe immu- nodeficiency and myeloid neoplasia. Approximately two thirds of patho- genic variants in GATA2 are null, and one third are missense substitutions. Germline pathogenic variants in GATA2 have been recognized as a major MDS and AML predisposition syndrome. Approximately 150 unique GATA2 germline pathogenic variants have been identified in about 550 patients. Clinical manifestations include monocytopenia and Mycobacterium avium complex (MonoMAC syndrome) infections, MDS with lymph- edema (Emberger syndrome), familial MDS/AML, primary MDS, and chronic neutropenia and dendritic cell, monocyte, and B and NK lymphoid deficiency (DCML deficiency). Hematologic presenta- tion is variable. Some patients present with cytopenia, a hypocellular marrow and monocytopenia, whereas others have severe immunode- ficiency, and others still present with MDS/AML and no preexisting relevant medical history or cytopenia. Immune deficiency results in HPV-­related infections such as warts or generalized verrucosis, dis- seminated nontuberculous mycobacterial, and systemic bacterial and fungal infections. Recurrent respiratory tract infections can result in lung disease, such as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Few patients have autoimmune dysregulation manifesting as autoimmune cytope- nia, arthritis, lupus, and others. Constitutional abnormalities, such as lymphedema, hydrocele, and congenital deafness, as well as abnormali- ties in pulmonary, CV, urogenital, and neurological systems have been observed in approximately 50% of patients (Fig. 517.3). In children and adolescents with primary MDS, pathogenic variants in GATA2 are a predominant germline predisposition accounting for 7% of all MDS cases, 15% of patients with advanced MDS, and 37% of patients Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

Chapter 517  u  Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes with Pancytopenia  3009 with MDS and monosomy 7. Among children with MDS, the prevalence of GATA2 pathogenic variants increases with age; 66% of adolescents with MDS and monosomy 7 carry germline GATA2 pathogenic variants. Median age of diagnosis with GATA2-­related MDS is approximately 10 years. Patients should be followed by a hematologist with expertise in bone marrow failure/MDS and by an immunologist. Blood counts should be done every 3 months, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics should be carried out annually. HSCT is the only curative option for MDS and carries an overall survival ranging from 60–85% depending on donor type and MDS disease severity. SAMD9/9L-­RELATED DISORDER Sterile alpha motif domain-­containing protein 9 (SAMD9) and the para- logue gene SAMD9-­like (SAMD9L) are located side-­by-­side on chro- mosome 7q21. They are interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-­α responsive proteins that play a role in antiviral response, tumor suppres- sion, inflammation, development, and endosomal fusion. Gain of function pathogenic variants, mostly missense, in these genes have variable pen- etrance. Thirty-­eight pathogenic variants have been identified in approxi- mately 110 patients. Multiple organs can be affected in those with germline SAMD9/9L pathogenic variants, including the hematologic, immunologic, endo- crine, and neurologic systems (see Table 517.2). The term MIRAGE syndrome was given to a constellation of abnormalities that include MDS, infection, restriction of growth (starting in utero), adrenal hypoplasia/insufficiency (with early onset), genital phenotypes (such as 46XY females and testicular dysgenesis), and enteropathy (often with reflux). Thrombocytopenia and anemia are often present at birth. In some patients, the anemia and thrombocytopenia resolve dur- ing infancy. Patients with SAMD9L pathogenic variants might show disease-­specific neurological findings with very variable age of onset. Severe cerebellar ataxia is observed in some, whereas others have cer- ebellar atrophy, dysmetria, nystagmus, white matter abnormalities, and loss of Purkinje cells. The majority of patients in both syndromes have hematologic manifestations which range from single lineage cytopenia to pancytopenia with hypocellular marrow, MDS with monosomy 7, or deletion 7q. Some patients have nonsyndromic SAMD9/9L related MDS. SAMD9/9L pathogenic variants are seen in 8–17% of pediatric MDS. The median age of presentation with SAMD9/9L related MDS is approx- imately 10 years. Ninety percent of children present in the early stage of MDS (refractory cytopenia of childhood), and another 10% present with advanced MDS. Transient monosomy 7 syndrome, the disappear- ance of monosomy 7 clones from the bone marrow, has been described in a few young children. It was hypothesized that pathogenic variants in the growth inhibitory genes, SAMD9/9L, confer gain of function that further suppress cell growth. Hence, monosomy 7, which depletes one allele of SAMD9/9L, reduces the growth inhibitory effect of the patho- genic variants. Somatic revertant mosaicism with expansion of benign, corrected hematopoiesis, has also been reported with normalization of blood counts and marrow cellularity for up to 20 years from diagnosis. Monitoring and treatment depend on the degree of blood count abnormalities, the presence of MDS, and the presence of syndromic disease. Children who received HSCT for SAMD9/9L–related MDS showed an overall survival of 85% in one study. OTHER INHERITED APLASTIC ANEMIAS A substantial number of genes that are associated with bone marrow fail- ure with pancytopenia have been identified with the emergence of whole genome screening methods (see Table 517.1). The specific gene-­associated disorders may vary by phenotype but frequently include physical malfor- mations, familial distribution, early age of disease onset, pancytopenia, and a risk of MDS and AML. Significant overlap exists between inherited pancytopenia syndromes and familial MDS and AML syndromes. SRP72-­Related Disorder This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by familial aplastic anemia and MDS. Some patients also have deafness. SRP72 encodes for a signal recognition particle 72 protein. SRP72 is part of a ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. ERCC6L2-­Related Disorder This autosomal recessive disorder features multilineage cytopenia, MDS, and physical malformations. Neurological and cranial abnor- malities are common in ERCC6L2-­related disorder and include devel- opmental delay, microcephaly, ataxia, dysmetria, generalized brain volume loss, retinal dystrophy, and low-­set ears. ERCC6L2 regulates transcription by RNA Pol II through an interaction with DNA-­PK; thereby, it promotes resolution of R loops and minimizes transcription-­ associated genome instability. The inherited BMF syndrome caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ERCC6L2 is thus a primary transcrip- tion deficiency and may not cause a DNA repair defect. Dubowitz Syndrome Dubowitz syndrome is characterized by a peculiar facies, infantile eczema, small stature, and mild microcephaly. The face is small, with a shallow supraorbital ridge, a nasal bridge at the same level as the fore- head, short palpebral fissures, variable ptosis, and micrognathia.

Approximately 10% of patients have hematopoietic disorders, including moderate pancyto- penia, hypoplastic anemia, bone marrow hypoplasia, and full-­blown aplastic anemia. Patients also have an increased risk of lymphoma and neuroblastoma. In about one third of patients, a genetic cause can be identified and includes biallelic pathogenic variants in NSUN2 (an RNA methyltransferase), biallelic pathogenic variants in LIG4 (a nuclear DNA ligase), or one copy deletion in several chromosome sites including 14q32, 17q24, -­14q32, -­17q24, and -­19q13. Seckel Syndrome Seckel syndrome, sometimes called “bird-­headed dwarfism,” is a devel- opmental disorder characterized by marked growth failure and mental deficiency, microcephaly, a hypoplastic face with a prominent nose, and low-­set and/or malformed ears. Approximately 25% of patients have aplastic anemia or malignancies. The syndrome is genetically heterogeneous and is associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in ATR, RBBP8, CENPJ, CEP152, CEP63, NIN, or ATRIP. A deletion at the14q21-­q22 locus has also been described. Reticular Dysgenesis Reticular dysgenesis is a severe form of immunodeficiency. It is mainly characterized by severe lymphopenia and neutropenia. Patients typically present with severe infections at birth or shortly thereafter. On physical examination, lymph nodes and tonsils are absent, and a thymic shadow on radiographs cannot be seen. Laboratory tests show absence of cellular and humoral immunity. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia may be evident. Bone marrow specimens show markedly reduced myeloid and lymphoid elements. Clonogenic assays of hematopoietic progeni- tors consistently show reduced to absent colony growth, suggesting that the disorder has its origins at the HSC level. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in mitochondrial AK2. The only curative therapy is HSCT. Schimke Immunoosseous Dysplasia Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the chromatin remodeling gene SMAR- CAL1. Patients have spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with exaggerated lumbar lordosis and a protruding abdomen. There are pigmentary skin changes and abnormally discolored and configured teeth. T-­cell immu- nodeficiency, progressive renal insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome, and early atherosclerosis are common causes of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 50% of patients have hypothyroidism; 50% have cerebral ischemia; 10% have bone marrow failure with neutropenia, thrombo- cytopenia, and anemia; and about 5% are predisposed to non-­Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighty percent of patients have lymphopenia and altered cellular immunity. Bone marrow transplantation has been successfully applied to patients with bone marrow failure or immunodeficiency. Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia Cartilage-­hair hypoplasia features metaphyseal dysostosis, short-­ limbed dwarfism, and fine sparse hair. Skeletal abnormalities may also include scoliosis, lordosis, chest deformity and varus lower limbs. GI abnormalities such as aganglionic megacolon have been reported. Most reported cases are of Finnish or Amish descent. In over 80% of patients, biallelic causal pathogenic variants in the noncoding RNA gene RMRP (RNA Component of Mitochondrial RNA Processing Endoribonuclease) can be found. Recently, biallelic pathogenic vari- ants in POP1 and in NEPRO have also been found to be associated with the disease. POP1 is a component of the RNAse-­MRP endoribo- nuclease complex. NEPRO is a nucleolar and neural progenitor protein that interacts with multiple subunits of the RNase MRP complex. The complex plays a role in rRNA and in mitochondrial RNA processing by cleavage at a priming site during replication. The hematological abnormalities include macrocytic anemia. In most cases the anemia is mild and self-­limited, but a proportion of patients have severe and persistent anemia that requires regular RBC transfusions. Lymphopenia occurs in 65% of patients. Severe immu- nodeficiency can occur, often with severe anemia. Neutropenia has been reported in 25% of patients. HSCT has been used successfully to reconstitute the hemato/immunological system. Lymphomas and basal cell carcinoma occur at an increased frequency among these patients. Pearson Syndrome Pearson syndrome is a mitochondrial metabolic disorder with various bone marrow impairments. Insufficiency of the exocrine pancreas, caused by acinar cell atrophy and fibrosis, develops in 30% of cases. The syn- drome is caused by a maternally inherited deletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encodes enzymes that are critical to oxidative phosphoryla- tion. Severe macrocytic anemia requiring transfusions is commonly pres- ent within the first year of life, sometimes at birth. Bone marrow aspirate typically shows ringed sideroblasts and prominent vacuolization of ery- throid and myeloid precursors. However, cases with pure red cell aplasia mimicking Diamond Blackfan anemia have been reported. Pancytopenia may occur alone or in association with hepatic failure, renal tubulopathy, and lactic acidosis. In such cases, platelet transfusions may also be required. Erythropoietin has been used for the anemia of renal failure. G-­CSF is indicated to prevent infections in patients with severe neutropenia. HSCT is traditionally not recommended for the hematopoietic complications of Pearson syndrome due to their tendency to improve spontaneously in most cases; nonetheless, HSCT has been used in rare cases with Pearson syndrome, and engraftment was achieved. Interestingly, HSCT was associ- ated not only with improved hematopoiesis but also with resolution of lac- tacidemia and acidosis. Patients may need pancreatic enzyme replacement if they develop malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Immune-­Related Pancytopenias Primary immunodeficiency, autoimmune, lymphoproliferative, and hemophagocytic disorders can be associated with pancytopenia. Auto- antibodies, hypersplenism, and bone marrow involvement are poten- tial mechanisms. Recognizable disorders include common variable immunodeficiency syndrome (Chapter 165), hemophagocytic lym- phohistiocytosis (Chapter 556.2), autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (Chapter 174.7), and other lymphoproliferative disorders. UNCLASSIFIED INHERITED BONE MARROW FAILURE SYNDROMES Unclassified IBMFSs are heterogeneous disorders that in many cases were shown to present as new syndromes. In other cases, they may be atypi- cal presentations of already characterized diseases. Unbiased approaches, such as study of comprehensive genetic panels of all known IBMFS genes regardless of the specific hematologic (e.g., isolated neutropenia or pancy- topenia) or nonhematologic manifestations, or WES/genome sequencing, have proved this to be true. These disorders do not fit into classic genetic bone marrow failure diseases because all features of any one disease may not be evident at presentation. All are characterized by various cytopenias caused by underproductive bone marrow with or without physical mani- festations. Compared with patients with classical disorders who present at a median age of 1 month, patients with unclassified disorders present later, at a median age of 9 months. Patients with unclassified IBMFSs can mani- fest single or multilineage cytopenia, aplastic anemia, MDS, or malignancy with variable expression of malformations. Table 517.5 lists criteria for the diagnosis, which include evidence of chronic bone marrow failure, in addi- tion to factors that indicate a high likelihood of inherited disease (e.g., fam- ily history, congenital anomalies, young age at presentation). When patients present later and without physical malformations, an acquired etiology cannot be ruled out. Detailed genetic testing for known IBMFS genes followed by approaches to discover novel genes and novel syndromes by WES/genome sequencing may identify an inherited etiology and define the disease. Determining the actual genetic cause helps group patients accord- ing to diseases and guides counseling and proper medical care. Imple- menting a treatment plan is urgent in many cases. In such patients, the management should be according to the type of complications that the patient has at presentation and the lessons that can be learned from published experience on unclassified cases in the literature.

ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY Therapeutic and recreational drugs, environmental toxins, infectious agents, radiation, and immune disorders can result in pancytopenia by direct destruction of hematopoietic progenitors, disruption of the marrow microenvironment, or immune-­mediated suppression of mar- row elements (Tables 518.1 and 518.2). A careful history of exposure to known risk factors should be obtained for every child presenting with pancytopenia. Even in the absence of the classic associated physi- cal findings, the possibility of a genetic predisposition to bone mar- row failure must also be considered (see Chapter 517). Many cases of acquired marrow failure in childhood are idiopathic, in that no caus- ative agent is identified. Many are probably immune mediated through cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cytokine destruction of marrow stem and progenitor cells. Patients with an initial diagnosis of acquired aplas- tic anemia may have developed somatic pathogenic variants in genes associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clonal hematopoiesis resulting from these acquired somatic genetic variants may over time lead to the development of MDS or AML. The overall incidence of acquired aplastic anemia is relatively low, with an approximate incidence in both children and Chapter 518 Acquired Pancytopenias John H. Fargo and Jeffrey D. Hord adults in the United States and Europe of 2–6 cases per 1 million popu- lation per year. The incidence is higher in Asia, with as many as 14 cases per 1 million per year in Japan. Severe bone marrow suppression can develop after exposure to many different therapeutic drugs and environmental chemicals, including certain chemotherapeutic agents, insecticides, antibiot- ics, anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and recreational drugs. Some of the most notable agents are benzene, chloramphenicol, gold, and 3,4-­methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or “ecstasy”). A number of viruses can either directly or indirectly result in bone marrow failure. Parvovirus B19 is classically associated with isolated red blood cell (RBC) aplasia, but in patients with sickle cell disease or immunodeficiency, it can result in transient pancyto- penia (see Chapter 298). Prolonged pancytopenia can occur after infection with many of the hepatitis viruses, herpesviruses, Epstein-­ Barr virus (see Chapter 301), cytomegalovirus (see Chapter 302), and HIV (see Chapter 322). Immune-­mediated acquired pancytopenia is also found to be prominent among acute, sporadic cases of aplastic anemia. Immu- nologic conditions, such as seronegative hepatitis, eosinophilic fas- ciitis, and thymoma, have been implicated in aplastic anemia. Patients with evidence of bone marrow failure should also be evaluated for inherited forms of marrow failure, paroxysmal noc- turnal hemoglobinuria (PNH; see Chapter 510), and collagen vascular diseases. Pancytopenia without peripheral blasts may be caused by bone marrow replacement by malignant cells including leukemia and solid tumor cells, such as neuroblastoma.

PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS The hallmark of aplastic anemia is peripheral pancytopenia, coupled with hypoplastic or aplastic bone marrow. The sever- ity of the clinical course is related to the degree of myelosup- pression. Severe aplastic anemia is defined as a condition in which ≥2 cell components have become seriously compromised (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3, platelet count <20,000/ mm3, reticulocyte count <1% after correction for hematocrit) in a patient whose bone marrow biopsy material has <30% cellular- ity. Approximately 65% of patients who first present with moder- ate aplastic anemia (absolute neutrophil count 500–­1,500/mm3, platelet count 20,000–100,000/mm3, reticulocyte count <1%) even- tually progress to meet the criteria for severe disease if they are sim- ply observed. Bone marrow failure may be a consequence of a direct cytotoxic effect on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a drug or chemical or may result from either cell-­mediated or antibody-­ dependent cytotoxicity. There is strong evidence that many cases of idiopathic aplastic anemia are caused by an immune-­mediated pro- cess, with increased circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes producing cytokines (interferon-­γ) that suppress hematopoiesis. Abnormal telomere length and telomerase activity in granulocytic precur- sors of patients with aplastic anemia suggest that early apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with aplastic anemia include uniparental disomy of 6p, monosomy 7/deletion of 7q, and trisomy 8, 6, or 15. Genes associated with aplastic anemia include telomere com- plex genes (TERT, TERC) and BCOR/BCORL, PIGA, DNMT3A, and ASXL1. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS, LABORATORY FINDINGS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Pancytopenia results in increased risks of cardiac failure, fatigue, infection, and bleeding. Acquired pancytopenia is typically char- acterized by anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia in the set- ting of elevated serum cytokine values. Other treatable disorders, such as cancer, collagen vascular disorders, PNH, and infections, that may respond to specific therapies (IV immunoglobulin for par- vovirus), should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Careful examination of the peripheral blood smear for RBC, leukocyte, and platelet morphologic features is important. A reticulocyte count should be performed to assess erythropoietic activity. In children, the possibility of congenital pancytopenia must always be consid- ered, and chromosomal breakage analysis should be performed to evaluate for Fanconi anemia (see Chapter 517) and telomere length to evaluate for telomeropathies. The presence of fetal hemoglobin suggests congenital pancytopenia but is not diagnostic. To assess for possible PNH, flow cytometric analysis of erythrocytes and granu- locytes for CD55 and CD59 is the most sensitive test. Bone mar- row examination should include both aspiration and biopsy, and the marrow should be carefully evaluated for morphologic features, cellularity, and cytogenetic abnormalities. TREATMENT The treatment of children with acquired pancytopenia requires comprehensive supportive care coupled with an attempt to treat the underlying etiology for marrow failure. For patients with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched family member donor, alloge- neic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a 90% chance of long-­term survival. Preparative regimens vary but typi- cally consist of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and horse antithy- mocyte globulin (ATG). Preliminary data also suggest that children with severe aplastic anemia can be successfully transplanted using alemtuzumab (humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52 on lymphocytes)–based conditioning. The risks associated with bone marrow transplantation include the immediate complications of transplantation, graft failure, and graft-­versus-­host disease. Late adverse effects associated with transplantation may include second- ary cancers, cataracts, short stature, hypothyroidism, and gonadal dysfunction (see Chapters 179 and 180). Only approximately 20% of patients have an HLA-­matched family member donor, so matched-­ related HSCT is not an option for the majority of patients. For patients without a sibling donor, the major form of therapy is immunosuppression with horse ATG and cyclosporine, with a response rate of 60–70%. The median time to response is 6 months. As many as 30–60% of patient responders experience relapse after discontinuation of immunosuppression, and some patients must continue cyclosporine for several years to maintain a hematologic Downloaded for mohamed ahmed (dr.mms2020@gmail.com) at University of Southern California from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 22, 2024.

Among those who relapse after immunosuppression, approximately 50% show response to a second course of ATG and cyclosporine. To accelerate neutrophil recovery, a hematopoietic colony-­stimulating factor (e.g., granulocyte CSF, granulocyte-­ macrophage CSF) is sometimes added to ATG and cyclosporine for treatment of patients with very severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <200/mm3), but there is no clear evidence that this treatment influences response rate or survival. Higher baseline reticulocyte count correlates with a higher probability of response to immunosuppression and survival. There is an inverse correla- tion between telomere length and the probability of relapse after immunosuppression. For patients who show no response to immunosuppression or who experience relapse after immunosuppression, matched-­unrelated HSCT and T-­cell–depleted haploidentical family member–donor HSCT are treatment options, with a response rate approaching 90%. Cord blood transplants have been performed in this refractory group of pediatric patients, with survival approximating 90%. Ongoing stud- ies using eltrombopag (an oral thrombopoietin mimetic agent) have shown promise in patients ≥15 years of age (mostly adults) with refrac- tory disease. The use of eltrombopag resulted in a hematologic response with improvements in platelet and neutrophil counts and hemoglobin levels in over half the patients. In patients who responded, bone mar- row biopsies demonstrated trilineage normalization of hematopoiesis, with some showing a durable response. High-­dose cyclophosphamide has been used successfully in the treatment of patients who are not good candidates for HSCT and have not had an adequate response to immunosuppression. This therapy leads to prolonged severe pancyto- penia, increasing the risk of life-­threatening infection, especially fungal infections. Other therapies that have been used in the past with incon- sistent results include androgens, corticosteroids, and plasmapheresis. Alemtuzumab as monotherapy in relapsed disease showed improved response rates and 3-­year survival compared to additional courses of ATG and cyclosporine. COMPLICATIONS The major complications of severe pancytopenia are predominantly related to the risk of life-­threatening bleeding from prolonged throm- bocytopenia or to infection secondary to protracted neutropenia. Patients with protracted neutropenia as a result of bone marrow failure are at risk not only for serious bacterial infections but also for invasive mycoses. Patients who have been transfused with RBCs regularly over a long period are at increased risk of developing alloantibodies to RBC antigens and may require iron chelation therapy for transfusional iron overload. The general principles of supportive care that have evolved from the use of chemotherapy-­related myelosuppression to treat patients with cancer should be fully extended to the care of patients with acquired pancytopenia. PROGNOSIS Spontaneous recovery from pancytopenia rarely occurs. If left untreated, severe pancytopenia has an overall mortality rate of approximately 50% within 6 months of diagnosis and of >75% over- all, with infection and hemorrhage being the major causes of mor- bidity and mortality. The majority of children with acquired severe aplastic anemia show response to allogeneic marrow transplanta- tion or immunosuppression, leaving them with normal or near-­ normal blood cell counts. PANCYTOPENIA CAUSED BY MARROW REPLACEMENT Processes that either infiltrate or replace the bone marrow can manifest as acquired pancytopenia. Infiltration can be caused by malignancy (classically, neuroblastoma or leukemia) or result from myelofibrosis, MDS, or osteopetrosis. Although uncommon, evi- dence of hypoplastic anemia can precede the onset of acute leuke- mia, generally by a few months. This relationship is important to appreciate in evaluating and monitoring children who present with what appears to be acquired aplastic anemia. Morphologic exami- nation of the peripheral blood and bone marrow and marrow cyto- genetic studies are critically important in making the diagnoses of leukemia, myelofibrosis, and MDS. Myelodysplasia is very rare in children, but when it occurs, its clinical course is more aggressive than the same category of MDS in adults. Pediatric MDS can be subdivided into refractory cytope- nia of childhood (peripheral blasts <2% and marrow blasts <5%) and MDS with excess blasts (peripheral blasts 2–19% and/or mar- row blasts 5–19%). Disease in children with >20% blasts is usually defined as AML. Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of bone marrow failure disorders that have in common ineffective hemato- poiesis that leads to pancytopenia over time. In one group, there are somatic variants (in >25 genes) leading to MDS. In another group, usually in younger patients (<55 years), there is autoimmune sup- pression of hematopoiesis by clonal expansion of T lymphocytes, particularly in those patients who look similar to patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia. In all patients, other causes of MDS (medications and vitamin B12, folate, or copper deficiencies) must be ruled out. A number of inherited conditions are associated with an increased risk for development of MDS, including Down syndrome, severe congenital neutropenia, Noonan syndrome, Fanconi anemia, tri- somy 8 mosaicism, neurofibromatosis, Shwachman-­Diamond syn- drome, and some familial MDS syndromes caused by pathogenic variants in ANKRD26, CEBPA, DDX41, ETV6, GATA2, RUNX1, and SRP72 genes. Significant clonal abnormalities are found within the marrow of approximately 50% of patients with MDS, with mono- somy 7 being most common but prognostically neutral. Those with a structurally complex karyotype have a very poor outcome (see Chapter 517). The transition time from pediatric MDS to acute leukemia is rela- tively short, 14–­26 months, so aggressive treatment such as HSCT must be considered shortly after diagnosis. With allogeneic HSCT, the survival rate is approximately 60%. One exception to such an aggressive therapeutic approach is MDS and AML in children with Down syndrome because these diseases in this specific population are very responsive to conventional chemotherapy, with long-­term survival rates >80%. The decision on how to treat a child with MDS who lacks a suit- able HSC donor should be made with the specific clonal abnormality found within the child’s marrow taken into consideration. Lenalid- omide produces the best responses among patients who have the chromosomal abnormality 5q−. Immunosuppressive therapy with ATG and cyclosporine is most effective in patients with trisomy 8, especially in the presence of a PNH clone. Imatinib mesylate tar- gets mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor family of genes found in patients with t(5;12) and del(4q12). The DNA hypomethylating agents azacitidine and decitabine have also been used in treating MDS without a known molecular target and have some effect.

All rights reserved. 3014  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood Red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused to increase the oxygen-­ carrying capacity of the blood, with the goal to increase or maintain satisfactory tissue oxygenation. This goal may not be achieved sim- ply by increasing the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration or hematocrit (Hct) by an RBC transfusion because tissue oxygenation depends on several additional factors, including oxygen off-­loading from RBCs, microvascular blood flow, and diffusion of oxygen into tissue cells. Although some attempts have been made to accurately relate post- transfusion Hb or Hct values to changes in posttransfusion tissue oxygenation (e.g., improvements in the ratio of cerebral vs mesen- teric oxygenation patterns assessed by serial near-­infrared spectros- copy measurements), decisions to transfuse RBCs per physiologic indications, rather than degree of anemia, remain investigational. This information can be applied to approaches for transfusion in both preterm infants/neonates and children/adolescents. However, neonates, especially extremely low birthweight infants (≤1,000 g), are not “small” children (i.e., RBC physiology and pathophysiology of anemia of prematurity are unique); thus RBC transfusions for neo- nates and children are considered separately. RBC TRANSFUSION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS Guidelines for RBC transfusions in children and adolescents are based on maintaining a specified Hb or Hct level considered to be optimal (per the best evidence available) for the clinical condition present at the time of transfusion. The guidelines are similar to those for adults (Table 519.1). Transfusions may be given more stringently to children because normal Hb levels are lower in healthy children than in adults and, as is often the case, most children do not have the underlying multior- gan, cardiorespiratory, and vascular diseases that develop with aging in adults to suggest a need for RBC transfusions. As a result, children may compensate better for RBC loss than elderly adults, thus requiring less RBC transfusion support. In general, there is increasing enthusi- asm for applying patient blood management strategies, encompassing conservative transfusion practices (i.e., accepting lower pretransfusion Hct values to “trigger” an RBC transfusion) to all patient ages with evidence-­based support. In the perioperative period, it is unnecessary for most children to maintain Hb of ≥8 g/dL, a level frequently desired for adults. Instead, Hb of ≥7 g/dL is an acceptable level, although the optimal value for individual patients is based on clinical and laboratory circumstances, as influenced by the following factors. The desired preoperative Hb level should consider the estimated blood loss for the surgical pro- cedure planned and the rate of bleeding. There should be a compel- ling reason to prescribe any postoperative RBC transfusion, such as continued bleeding with hemodynamic instability because most chil- dren (without continued bleeding) can restore their RBC mass with iron therapy (in a relatively short time). The most important measures in the treatment of acute hemorrhage are to control the hemorrhage and, if blood loss is modest, to restore the circulating blood volume and tissue perfusion with crystalloid or, less often, colloid solutions. If the estimated blood loss is >25% of the circulating blood volume (>15 mL/kg of an estimated 60 mL/kg total estimated blood volume) and the patient’s condition is unstable despite initial intravenous (IV) fluids, RBC transfusions should be given with- out undue hesitation, along with plasma transfusions at a 1:1 ratio of RBC/plasma volumes. Some experts recommend transfusing plate- lets early if bleeding is sustained or “massive” (i.e., approximating one blood volume or 60 mL/kg, which may occur very quickly in infants and small pediatric patients). Details of combined RBC and plasma transfusions, the volume ratio transfused, and considerations for add- ing platelet transfusions to treat bleeding patients are controversial. Accordingly, each hospital should develop and follow a “massive trans- fusion” protocol to ensure consistent practices. In critically ill children with severe cardiac or pulmonary disease requiring assisted ventilation, it is common practice to maintain the Hb level close to the normal range, although the efficacy of this practice has not been well documented. A similar approach is used for children with acute cardiac, pulmonary, or cardiopulmonary disorders man- aged with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pretransfusion Hb level or Hct that should “trigger” an RBC transfusion remains controversial (i.e., restrictive or a low pretransfu- sion level vs liberal or a high pretransfusion level) despite a substantial amount of published information, including randomized clinical trials. The current trend in critical care settings is to transfuse RBCs conser- vatively, following restrictive guidelines, and to permit modest anemia because there appears to be no disadvantage to conservative/restric- tive transfusion practices, and some patients with Hb levels maintained close to the normal range by RBC transfusions (i.e., liberal guidelines) have poorer outcomes. Studies in critically ill adults demonstrated bet- ter outcomes when Hb level was maintained at 7–9 g/dL vs 10–12 g/dL. Anemic adults with significant cardiac disease did better with Hb level maintained at 13 g/dL rather than 10 g/dL. A similar study in chil- dren admitted to intensive care units found no inferiority when RBC Chapter 519 Red Blood Cell Transfusions and Erythropoietin Therapy Patricia E. Zerra and Cassandra D.

Chapter 519  u  Red Blood Cell Transfusions and Erythropoietin Therapy  3015 transfusions were given by restrictive guidelines (transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL). It must be remembered that the children studied were in stable clinical status and needed few transfusions. Therefore, results of the trial cannot be automatically generalized to all patients admitted to ICUs because unstable critically ill children (who were not included in the study) may need more liberal RBC transfusion approaches. With chronic anemia, the decision to transfuse RBCs should not be based solely on blood Hb levels because children compensate well and may be asymptomatic despite low Hb levels. Patients with iron-­ deficiency anemia are often treated successfully with oral iron alone, even at Hb levels <5 g/dL. Factors other than Hb concentration to be considered in the decision to transfuse RBCs include (1) the patient’s symptoms, signs, and compensatory capacities; (2) the presence of underlying cardiorespiratory, vascular, and central nervous system dis- ease; (3) the cause and anticipated course of the anemia; and (4) alter- native therapies, such as recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) therapy, which is known to reduce the need for RBC transfusions and to improve the overall condition of children with chronic renal insuffi- ciency (see Chapter 572.2). In anemias that are likely to be permanent, it is also important to balance the detrimental effects of the degree of long-­standing anemia on growth and development against the poten- tial toxicity associated with repeated transfusions (i.e., iron overload and risks of transfusion-­transmitted diseases) given to maintain the Hb concentration at a specified level. RBC transfusions for disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are discussed in Chapters 511.1 and 511.10. RBC TRANSFUSION IN PRETERM INFANTS AND NEONATES For neonates, almost all aspects of RBC transfusions remain contro- versial—the accepted indications for RBC transfusions, restrictive vs liberal pretransfusion Hb/Hct levels, optimal RBC product to be transfused, and fresh vs stored RBC units—and clinical practices vary greatly. Generally, RBCs are given to maintain an Hb value believed to be the most desirable for each neonate’s clinical status. Restrictive guidelines (i.e., lower pretransfusion Hb/Hct levels) have been com- pared to more liberal transfusion practices, but both short-­term and long-­term results and outcomes have been inconsistent and contro- versial, particularly as to neurodevelopmental status. Two multicenter randomized controlled trials showed no difference in survival or neu- rodevelopmental outcome in premature infants receiving RBC trans- fusion based on liberal versus restrictive Hb thresholds. Importantly, a lower Hb threshold was not inferior to a higher threshold for RBC transfusion. However, these studies had limitations, and accordingly, conventional guidelines are recommended to avoid problems caused by undertransfusion or overtransfusion (see Table 519.1). During the first few weeks of life, all neonates experience a decline in circulating RBC mass caused by physiologic factors and, in sick prema- ture infants, by phlebotomy blood losses. In healthy term infants, the nadir Hb value rarely falls to <11 g/dL at age 10-­12 weeks. This benign drop in Hb does not require transfusions. In contrast, the decline occurs earlier and is more pronounced in premature infants, in whom the mean Hb concentration falls to approximately 7 g/dL in infants weighing <1 kg at birth, resulting in the anemia of prematurity, for which there often is need for RBC transfusions, particularly when the anemia is worsened by blood draws for laboratory testing. A key reason that the nadir Hb values of premature infants are lower than those of term infants is the premature infant’s relatively dimin- ished plasma EPO level in response to anemia (see Chapters 139 and 496). Another factor is the rapid disappearance of EPO from infant plasma (i.e., accelerated metabolism). Low plasma EPO levels provide a rationale for the possible use of recombinant EPO in the treatment of anemia of prematurity; treatment with EPO and iron effectively stimu- late neonatal erythropoiesis. Recombinant EPO has not been widely accepted as a treatment for anemia of prematurity (see Chapter 139). Many low birthweight preterm infants need RBC transfusions (see Table 519.1). Although the practice to maintain a very high Hb level >13 g/dL (or Hct >40%) was once widely recommended, currently more restrictive guidelines have been suggested. However, one pro- spective, observational, multisite, birth cohort study of very low birth- weight infants (≤1500 g) found a sixfold increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) when an infant’s hemoglobin was ≤8 g/dL. Impor- tantly, RBC transfusion in a given week did not significantly increase the rate of NEC in this population. Consistent with the rationale for oxygen delivery in neonates with severe respiratory disease, it also seems appropriate to keep the Hb value relatively high in neonates with severe cardiac disease leading to either cyanosis or congestive heart fail- ure, but convincing and consistent data are lacking. The optimal Hb level for neonates facing major surgery has not been established. However, it seems reasonable to begin surgery in neonates with the Hb level no lower than 10 g/dL (hematocrit >30%) and to maintain that value during major surgery because even modest blood loss will have a relatively large effect on the small blood volume of the neonate. Neonates with underlying pulmonary problems have limited ability to compensate for anemia due to the inability to increase venti- lation and the inferior off-­loading of oxygen because of the diminished interaction between fetal Hb and 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate. Postopera- tively, a lower pretransfusion Hb value should be followed to “trigger” a transfusion. Stable neonates do not require RBC transfusion, regardless of their blood Hb levels, unless they exhibit clinical symptoms attributable to anemia. Proponents of RBC transfusions for symptomatic anemia in preterm neonates believe that the low RBC mass contributes to tachy- pnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, apnea and bradycardia, feeding difficulties, and lethargy, which can be alleviated by transfusion of RBCs. However, anemia is only one of several possible causes of these problems, and RBC transfusions should only be given when clinical benefit seems likely. RBC PRODUCT AND DOSE The RBC product of choice to transfuse neonates, infants, children, and adolescents is prestorage leukocyte-­reduced RBCs suspended in an anticoagulant/preservative storage solution at Hct of approximately 60–70% for storage up to 35–42 days. For those infants with birth- weight <1,500 g, irradiation is recommended to prevent transfusion-­ associated graft-­versus-­host disease. Additionally, both leukoreduction and cytomegalovirus-­seronegative RBC units have been recommended by some (estimated risk of transfusion-­transmission cytomegalovirus [TT-­CMV] infection: 0–0.3% per unit) as first-­line therapy to prevent TT-­CMV. However, given the low risks of TT-­CMV with improvements in modern leukoreduction techniques, others have recommended use of leukoreduced blood without need for CMV antibody testing as an acceptably safe and low-­risk alternative. RBC transfusion should not be delayed if CMV-­negative blood is unavailable, and CMV-­untested leukoreduced blood should be used because the risk of TT-­CMV is relatively low, with possibly more harm to the patient if transfusion is withheld or delayed. The usual dose is 10–15 mL/kg, but transfusion volumes vary greatly depending on clinical circumstances (continued vs arrested bleeding, hemolysis). For neonates, some prefer a centri- fuged RBC concentrate (Hct 70–90%). Unless transfusions are being given to treat rapid bleeding, RBCs are infused slowly (over 2–4 hours) at a dose of approximately 10–15 mL/kg. In this small-­volume setting, because of the small quantity of extracellular fluid transfused and the slow rate of infusion, the type of RBC anticoagulant/preservative solu- tion does not pose any risk for premature infants when the dose does not exceed 20 mL/kg. However, the additive solutions (e.g., AS-­1, AS-­3, AS-­5) have not been studied by comparative randomized clinical trials in the setting of >20 mL/kg dosing or massive transfusion settings such as cardiopulmonary bypass, ECMO, or massive transfusion for trauma. Although a few anecdotal reports suggest RBCs in additive solutions are safe for large-­volume transfusions while awaiting more definitive information, some hospitals that manage these complex neonates and children maintain separate inventories of different RBC products earmarked either for neonates and infants (e.g., citrate-­phosphate-­ dextrose or citrate-­phosphate-­dextrose-­adenine) or for older children (e.g., additive solutions).

Concerns about high concen- trations of extracellular potassium, loss of 2,3-­diphosphoglycerate, altered RBC shape and deformability, and nitric oxide quenching were found not to pose clinically significant problems. Preterm neonates allocated to “fresh RBC” (<7 days’ storage) transfusions vs “stored RBC” (up to 42 days’ stor- age) transfusions have no advantage for fresh RBC transfusions in altering the composite clinical outcome of mortality, plus NEC, retinopathy of pre- maturity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and intraventricular hemorrhage, or of the individual disorders. For children weighing >30 kg who are to undergo elective surgery for whom RBC transfusions are likely to be needed, autologous RBC transfu- sions offer an alternative to donor allogeneic RBCs. Preoperative autolo- gous blood collections from the patient occur up to 6 weeks before the surgery and require careful considerations for the volume to be drawn, vascular access, and use of EPO and iron to help restore the donated RBCs. Acute normovolemic hemodilution occurs in the preoperative period, in which blood is withdrawn from the patient and replaced with saline, a task often difficult in centers without experience in the process. Salvaged autologous blood is collected from blood loss during the operation but is impractical unless the volume of blood salvaged is fairly large to permit washing and transfusion of a significant number of RBCs. Because of all these difficulties, plus the relative safety of the usual allogeneic blood sup- ply, autologous RBC transfusions are not typically used in the pediatric setting.

CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS Guidelines for platelet (PLT) support of children and adolescents with quantitative and qualitative PLT disorders are similar to those for adults, in whom the risk of life-­threatening bleeding occurring after injury or spontaneously can be related to the severity of thrombocyto- penia, although somewhat imprecisely (Table 520.1). For children and adolescents with overt bleeding, therapeutic PLT transfusions should be given when the blood PLT count falls below 50 × 109/L and repeated as needed to maintain the PLT count >50 × 109/L during bleeding and for 48 hours after bleeding ceases to allow the clot to “stabilize.” Similarly, for a major invasive procedure (e.g., surgical), the PLT count should be maintained >50 × 109/L until any bleeding that occurs ceases and the patient is stable. For minor invasive procedures (e.g., lumbar puncture, intravascular catheter placement), practices vary. It is reasonable to maintain the PLT count >25 × 109/L, although these procedures often are performed in children with cancer or recent transplants, and it is important to be mindful of possible clot- ting abnormalities and anemia that may affect hemostasis beyond the effects of thrombocytopenia. Historical studies of patients with throm- bocytopenia resulting from bone marrow failure suggest that the risk of spontaneous bleeding increases when blood PLT levels fall to <20 × 109/L, particularly when hemorrhagic risk factors (infection, organ failure, clotting abnormalities, minor skin/mucosal bleeding, mucosal lesions, severe graft-­versus-­host disease [GVHD], anemia) are present. In this high-­risk setting, prophylactic PLT transfusions are given to maintain a PLT count >20 × 109/L. This threshold has been challenged by several studies of adult patients, who in many instances were carefully Chapter 520 Platelet Transfusions Patricia E. Zerra and Cassandra D. Josephson selected to be in relatively good clinical condition without hemor- rhagic risk factors. Consequently, a lower PLT transfusion trigger of 10 × 109/L is recommended for stable (i.e., low-­risk) patients. In practice, severe thrombocytopenia that is prolonged beyond 1 week usually becomes complicated by the development of risk factors, including fever, antimicrobial therapy, GVHD, active bleeding, need for an invasive procedure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and liver or kidney dysfunction with clotting abnormalities. In these situations, prophylactic PLT transfusions are given to maintain relatively high PLT counts (e.g., at least >30 × 109/L). Despite the desire by some physicians to elevate the blood PLT count to 80 × 109/L or 100 × 109/L, there are no definitive data to justify a true benefit of PLT transfusions given at a PLT count >50 × 109/L, unless bleeding is ongoing despite a PLT count between 50 and 100 × 109/L and thrombocytopenia seems to be the only cause for the bleeding. Qualitative PLT disorders may be inherited or acquired, as in advanced hepatic or renal insufficiency or when blood flows through an extracor- poreal circuit, such as during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass. In patients with inherited disor- ders, PLT transfusions are justified only if the risk of significant bleeding is quite high or if bleeding is overt because inherited PLT dysfunction often is lifelong and repeated transfusions may lead to alloimmunization and refractoriness (i.e., poor response to PLT transfusions). Accordingly, pro- phylactic PLT transfusions are rarely justified unless an invasive procedure is planned, and therapeutic PLT transfusions must be given judiciously. When managing patients with PLT dysfunction, it is important to remember that an abnormal test result with a modern PLT function device or, historically, a bleeding time more than twice the upper limit of normal provides diagnostic evidence of PLT dysfunction. However, an abnormal bleeding time or any other abnormal laboratory test is poorly predictive of hemorrhagic risk or the need to transfuse PLTs. Alternative therapies, par- ticularly desmopressin acetate, should be considered to avoid PLT trans- fusions. Antiplatelet medications (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) should also be avoided. INFANTS AND NEONATES In neonates, thrombopoiesis and the risks of bleeding are substantially different from that in older children; the approach to thrombocytopenia and PLT transfusions likewise differs (see Table 520.1). Thrombopoietin (TPO) levels are higher in healthy neonates than in older individuals. Rela- tive to adult PLT progenitors, megakaryocyte progenitors of neonates are more sensitive to TPO, have higher proliferative potential, and give rise to larger megakaryocyte colonies. Fetal/neonatal megakaryocytes are smaller in size and have lower ploidy than do their adult counterparts; this Table 520.1     Guidelines for Pediatric Platelet (PLT) Transfusion* CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 1.	 Maintain PLT count >50 × 109/L with bleeding. 2.	 Maintain PLT count >50 × 109/L with major invasive procedure; >25 × 109/L with minor. 3.	 Maintain PLT count >20 × 109/L and marrow failure WITH ­hemorrhagic risk factors. 4.	 Maintain PLT count >10 × 109/L and marrow failure WITHOUT hemorrhagic risk factors. 5.	 Maintain PLT count at any level with PLT dysfunction PLUS ­bleeding or invasive procedure.

Chapter 520  u  Platelet Transfusions  3017 information is important because small megakaryocytes of low ploidy pro- duce fewer PLTs than do larger megakaryocytes of higher ploidy. Presum- ably, this allows the expanding marrow of the growing fetus and neonate to be supplied with sufficient numbers of megakaryocytes, yet not allowing blood PLT counts to become excessively high during proliferation because of the lower numbers of PLTs produced by each megakaryocyte. An important contrasting point is that older children and adults respond to situations of increased demand for PLTs by first increasing megakaryocyte size and ploidy, which is followed in 3–5 days by increased megakaryocyte number. In thrombocytopenic neonates, megakaryocyte numbers but not size increase. Moreover, although cytoplasmic matura- tion is achieved per TPO stimulation, increases in ploidy are relatively diminished and actually appear to be inhibited by TPO, resulting in large numbers of small megakaryocytes that are cytoplasmically mature but with low ploidy and, consequently, lower PLT production. PLT counts ≥150 × 109/L are present after 17 weeks’ gestational age, and it is accepted that neonates have PLT counts in the same range as older children and adults (150,000–450,000/μL). However, other data suggest a lower limit of 120,000/μL for extremely small preterm infants. Approxi- mately 1% of term infants demonstrate PLT counts <150 × 109/L, but bleeding in such infants is rare. In contrast, 18–35% of preterm neonates treated in intensive care units (ICUs) exhibit PLT counts <150 × 109/L at some time during admission, with approximately 4% overall receiving PLT transfusions. Notably, when only extremely low birthweight preterm infants (<1 kg) were considered in one report, 70% had PLT counts <150 × 109/L, and 5–9% of infants received platelet transfusions. Debate continues in the United States as to the appropriate prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold for neonates, with a wide range in practice patterns. Multiple pathogenetic mechanisms underlie thrombocytopenia in these sick neonates, including predominantly accelerated PLT destruc- tion plus diminished PLT production, as evidenced by decreased numbers of megakaryocyte progenitors and relatively low upregulation of TPO lev- els during thrombocytopenia, when compared with thrombocytopenic children and adults. PLT counts <100 × 109/L pose significant clinical risks for premature neonates. Bleeding time may be prolonged at PLT counts <100 × 109/L in infants with birthweight <1,500 g, and PLT dysfunction is suggested by bleeding times (a test no longer performed) that are disproportionately long for the degree of thrombocytopenia. The risk of hemorrhage may be increased in thrombocytopenic infants. However, in a randomized trial, transfusing PLTs prophylactically whenever the PLT count fell to <150 × 109/L (i.e., at the lower limit of normal range) to maintain the average PLT count at >200 × 109/L, compared to not transfusing PLTs until the PLT count fell to <50 × 109/L to maintain the average PLT count at approxi- mately 100 × 109/L, did not result in a lower incidence of intracranial hem- orrhage (28% vs 26%, respectively). A U.S. multicenter observational study of very low birthweight infants in six neonatal ICUs found wide variation in PLT thresholds for transfusion, ranging from 10,000 to 139,000/μL in the first week of life and <10,000/μL to >50,000/μL after the first week. The most common thresholds were 80,000–89,000/μL in the first 7 days of life and 40,000–49,000/μL after the first 7 days. Furthermore, after control- ling for severity of thrombocytopenia, the authors found PLT transfusions were not associated with a lower risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. Thus, there is no documented benefit for prophylactic PLT transfusions to main- tain PLT counts within the normal range or to correct moderate thrombo- cytopenia (PLT count >50 × 109/L). As an exception, infants with inherited PLT dysfunction disorders and bleeding, as well as infants at high risk of bleeding because of acquired PLT dysfunction, such as during ECMO, typically receive transfusions to keep their PLT counts >100 × 109/L. One randomized clinical trial reported a significantly higher rate of new major hemorrhage or death within 28 days of randomization in very low birthweight neonates given prophylactic PLT transfusions at a pretrans- fusion PLT count of 50,000/μL (26%) vs a pretransfusion PLT count of 25,000/μL (19%), irrespective of their baseline risk of bleeding. Results are too preliminary to permit changes in practice but support other published findings indicating no need to maintain normal PLT counts and add to the belief that a PLT count of 50,000/μL is too high to serve as the pretransfu- sion PLT count for transfusions in stable low birthweight neonates. Table 520.1 lists pediatric PLT transfusion guidelines that are accept- able to many neonatologists. One particularly contentious issue is how to manage critically ill neonates receiving agents known to adversely affect PLT function (e.g., indomethacin, nitric oxide, antibiotics). Some reports suggest increased risk of bleeding for these neonates, but the efficacy of PLT transfusions has not been convincingly proven, particularly when given prophylactically. For optimal PLT transfusion practices, each hos- pital should modify their guidelines to comply with local practices, with audits and reviews done to avoid violations of the recommended practices. PLATELET PRODUCTS AND DOSING In the United States, two types/sources of PLT units are available, although any one blood bank or hospital may stock only one of these types. Whole blood–derived PLT units (PLT concentrates) and PLT units collected by apheresis (apheresis PLTs) differ in their PLT content and plasma volume. Although a PLT concentrate contains approximately 5.5-­10 × 1010 PLTs in approximately 50 mL, and 1 apheresis PLT unit contains at least 3 × 1011 PLTs in 300–600 mL, the PLT content may vary considerably among dif- ferent blood suppliers. Accordingly, it is prudent for hospital blood banks to confirm the composition of the PLT units they issue for transfusion, at the very least by contacting their blood supplier. It is often easier to use PLT concentrates for infants and small children because apheresis PLTs usually need to be prepared as aliquots to provide the correct dose (10–15 mL/kg). However, many blood centers exclusively provide only one type of PLT component. Platelet products generally have a 5-­day expiration time, although 7-­day storage has been approved for apheresis platelet units within certain stipulations to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination and are stored at room temperature with constant agitation. The posttransfusion goal of most PLT transfusions is to raise the PLT count well above 50 × 109/L, hopefully to ≥100 × 109/L. These increases can be achieved consistently in children weighing up to 30 kg by infusion of 5–10 mL/kg of standard (unmodified) PLT con- centrates, obtained either from PLT concentrates or apheresis PLTs. For larger children, the appropriate dose is 4-­8 pooled PLT concentrates or 1 apheresis unit. Because PLT concentration/quantity varies in different PLT products made available for transfusion, each hospital should monitor posttransfusion PLT counts to determine the dose that works best locally. PLT concentrates may be transfused as rapidly as the patient’s overall condition permits, certainly within 2 hours, but not longer than 4 hours. Neonates/infants requiring repeated PLT transfusions should receive leukocyte-­reduced blood products to diminish HLA alloimmunization and PLT refractoriness and to reduce the risk of transfusion-­transmission cytomegalovirus infection (TT-­CMV). For those infants weighing <1,500 g at birth, irradiation is recommended to prevent transfusion associated GVHD. Additionally, some recommend both leukoreduction and CMV-­ seronegative RBC units (estimated risk of TT-­CMV infection: 0–0.3% per unit) as first-­line therapy to prevent TT-­CMV. However, given the low risks of TT-­CMV with improvements in modern leukoreduction techniques, others have recommended use of leukoreduced blood from CMV-­untested donors as an acceptably safe and low-­risk alternative. PLT transfusion should not be delayed if CMV-­negative units are unavailable; CMV-­untested leukoreduced units should be used because the risk of TT-­ CMV is relatively low and more harm may come to the patient if transfu- sion is withheld or delayed. Routinely reducing the volume of PLT concentrates for infants and small children by additional centrifugation steps is both unnecessary and unwise. Transfusion of 10–­15 mL/kg of an unmodified PLT concentrate is adequate because it adds approximately 10 × 109 PLTs to 70 mL of blood (estimated intravascular blood volume of 1 kg neonate), a dose/volume calculated to increase the PLT count by 100 × 109/L. This calculated incre- ment is consistent with actual posttransfusion increment reported in patients. Moreover, 10–15 mL/kg is not an excessive transfusion volume, provided that the intake of other IV fluids, medications, and nutrients is monitored and adjusted. It is important to select PLT units for transfusion with the donor ABO group identical to that of the neonate/infant and to avoid repeated transfusion of group O PLTs to group A or B recipients, because passive transfusion anti-­A or anti-­B in group O plasma can occasionally lead to intravascular hemolysis.

GTX has been used sparingly in older infants and children. The current ability to collect markedly higher numbers of neutrophils from donors stimu- lated with combined recombinant granulocyte colony-­stimulating factor (G-­CSF) plus dexamethasone has led to renewed interest for patients with neutropenic infections, particularly when severe neutro- penia is prolonged (e.g., in the setting of placental/cord blood hemato- poietic progenitor cell transplantation). As a result, higher neutrophil yields are collected with this approach, making the addition of GTX to antibiotics a therapeutic consideration. This is especially true at insti- tutions where neutropenic patients continue to die of progressive bac- terial and fungal infections or to suffer substantial morbidity despite optimal antiinfection measures, including antibiotics and recombinant myeloid growth factors. GRANULOCYTE TRANSFUSIONS FOR CHILDREN The use of GTX added to antibiotics for children with severe neutrope- nia (neutrophil count <0.5 × 109/L) because of bone marrow failure is similar to that for adults. Unfortunately, two randomized clinical trials comparing antibiotics plus GTX from donors stimulated with G-­CSF plus dexamethasone vs antibiotics without GTX to treat neutropenic infections in children have not provided definitive guidelines. How- ever, in practice, neutropenic patients with bacterial infections usually show response to antibiotics alone, provided bone marrow function recovers within the first 7–10 days of infection onset, so that severe neutropenia is relatively brief. Children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia show rapid response to induction chemo- therapy and are rarely candidates for GTX. In contrast, infected chil- dren with more sustained bone marrow failure and consequent severe neutropenia (e.g., acute myeloblastic leukemia, malignant neoplasms resistant to treatment, severe aplastic anemia, placental/cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant recipients) may benefit when GTX is added to antibiotics. Currently, the efficacy of GTX obtained from G-­CSF plus dexameth- asone–stimulated donors for bacterial sepsis unresponsive to antibiot- ics in patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophil count <0.5 × 109/L) is not well supported by trials in children. Furthermore, GTX efficacy for yeast and fungal infections remains unproven, despite transfusing GTX with relatively large numbers of neutrophils. Children with qualitative neutrophil defects (neutrophil dys- function) usually have adequate or even increased numbers of blood neutrophils but develop serious infections because their neutrophils kill pathogenic microorganisms inefficiently. Neutrophil dysfunc- tion syndromes are rare; accordingly, no definitive studies have established GTX efficacy. However, several patients with progressive life-­threatening infections have shown striking improvement with the addition of GTX, often given for long periods, to antimicrobial therapy. These disorders are chronic and thus associated with an increased risk of alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens, specifi- cally to Kell system antigens on the red blood cells in some patients with chronic granulomatous disease, and GTX is recommended only when serious infections are clearly unresponsive to antimicro- bial drugs. GRANULOCYTE TRANSFUSION FOR NEONATES Neonates are unusually susceptible to severe bacterial infections, and a number of defects of neonatal defenses contribute to this susceptibil- ity, including actual or “relative” neutropenia. Neonates with fulminant sepsis who exhibit relative neutropenia (blood neutrophil count <3.0 × 109/L during the first week of life and <1.0 × 109/L thereafter) and a severely diminished neutrophil marrow storage pool (with <10% of nucleated marrow cells being postmitotic neutrophils) are at risk of dying if treated only with antibiotics. Despite this risk, GTX has not provided the solution. GTX is rarely used in neonates because the results of clinical trials are mixed and not uniformly convincing, and it is difficult to obtain neutrophil apheresis concentrates in a timely fashion. Current data are insufficient to conclude that recombinant myeloid growth factors have a role in treating septic neonates, despite demon- stration that both G-­CSF and granulocyte-­macrophage CSF enhance myelopoiesis and raise neutrophil counts in infants. In contrast to the uncertain role of G-­CSF and GM-­CSF to treat infections in many clinical settings, it is important to remember that G-­CSF is effica- cious for the long-­term treatment of several types of severe congenital neutropenias. GRANULOCYTE PRODUCT If the decision to provide a GTX has been made, an adequate dose of neutrophils/granulocytes collected by leukapheresis must be trans- fused as shortly after collection as possible. To facilitate this goal, expe- rienced donors with recently performed negative testing for HIV and hepatitis (usually within the past 30 days) are selected. Granulocyte donors should be documented to be cytomegalovirus antibody nega- tive (seronegative). These donors should also be ABO/Rh crossmatch compatible with the recipient because there is a large volume of red blood cells in the granulocyte product. Granulocyte Product Dosing Neonates and infants weighing <10 kg should receive 1-­2 × 109/kg neutrophils per each GTX. Larger infants and small children should receive a minimal total dose of 1 × 1010 neutrophils per each GTX. The preferred dose for adolescents is 5-­8 × 1010 neutrophils per each GTX, a dose requiring donors to be stimulated with G-­CSF plus dexametha- sone. GTX should be given daily until either the infection resolves or the blood neutrophil count is sustained above 1.5 × 109/L for a few days. Because neutrophils transfused through the GTX often passively increase the blood neutrophil count, it may be necessary to skip 1-­2 days of GTXs to accurately assess whether endogenous myelopoiesis and neutrophil production have recovered.

Chapter 522  u  Plasma Transfusions  3019 Guidelines for plasma transfusion in pediatric patients are similar to those for adults but with the understanding that plasma levels of coagulant and anticoagulant proteins can be developmentally low in preterm infants (Table 522.1). Therefore transfusions of plasma and plasma-­derived com- mercial concentrates should be determined by actual bleeding or a signifi- cant risk of bleeding, not simply by prolonged clotting time results. Plasma is transfused to replace clinically significant congenital or acquired defi- ciencies of plasma proteins for which more highly purified protein concen- trates, treated to reduce infectious disease risks, or recombinant products are not available. Plasma and plasma derivatives are required to provide clotting proteins when bleeding is actually occurring or in settings when prevention of bleeding is deemed critical. PLASMA PRODUCTS AND PATIENT TESTING Two interchangeable plasma products are available for transfusion, plasma frozen within 8 hours of collection (fresh-­frozen plasma [FFP]) and plasma frozen within 24 hours of collection (F24). Although levels of fac- tors V and VIII are modestly reduced in F24 (generally, not more than 25% lower), they are equally efficacious for all indications for which plasma is transfused in infants and children (see Table 522.1). Recommendations for the volume of plasma to be transfused vary with the specific protein being replaced and the severity of the deficiency, but a starting dose of 15 mL/kg is usually sufficient to elevate plasma levels satisfactorily. Transfusion of plasma is efficacious for the treatment of deficiencies of clotting factors II, V, X, and XI. Deficiencies of factor XIII and fibrinogen are treated either with cryoprecipitate or specific commercial concentrates; for patients being given large doses of plasma (e.g., in massive transfusion settings or to treat bleeding in liver failure), however, additional sources of fibrinogen may not be necessary because plasma contains large amounts of fibrinogen. It is always useful to include a measurement of plasma fibrino- gen (a separate test) when performing clotting assays, including prothrom- bin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). PLASMA TRANSFUSION IN CHILDREN Transfusion of plasma is not recommended for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A or B, von Willebrand disease, or factor VII defi- ciency because safer plasma-­derived and recombinant factor products for VII, VIII, IX, and von Willebrand factor are available. Moreover, mild to moderate hemophilia A and certain types of von Willebrand disease can be treated with intranasal or intravenous desmopressin (see Chapter 526). An important use of plasma is for rapid reversal of the effects of warfarin in patients who are actively bleeding or who require emergency surgery (in whom functional deficiencies of vitamin K–dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X cannot be rapidly reversed by vitamin K administration). Plasma-­ derived and virally inactivated prothrombin “complex” concentrates can also be used for this purpose. Results of screening coagulation tests (PT/INR, aPTT, thrombin time, and plasma fibrinogen level) should not be assumed to reflect the integrity of the coagulation system or be regarded as indications for plasma transfu- sions. This is particularly true for neonates. To justify plasma transfusions, coagulation test results must be related to the patient’s clinical condition in regard to bleeding and the risk of bleeding. Transfusion of plasma in patients with chronic liver disease and prolonged clotting times is not rec- ommended unless bleeding is present, or an invasive procedure is planned because prophylactic correction of the clotting factor deficiencies is brief and of questionable benefit. Plasma also contains several anticoagulant proteins (antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S) whose deficiencies have been associated with thrombosis. In select situations, plasma as replacement therapy along with anticoagulant treatment may be appropriate in patients with these disorders; when available, purified concentrates are preferred. Other indi- cations for plasma include replacement fluid during plasma exchange in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (i.e., thrombotic microangiopathies) or other disorders for which plasma is likely to be beneficial. This includes plasma exchange in a patient with overt bleeding caused by the underlying disorder (e.g., Goodpasture syndrome, vasculi- tis) or disorders with significant severe coagulopathy that would substan- tially worsen with replacement by albumin solutions only. Plasma is not indicated for correction of hypovolemia or as immunoglobulin replacement therapy because safer alternatives exist (albumin or crystalloid solutions and IV immunoglobulin, respectively). PLASMA TRANSFUSION IN NEONATES In neonates, clotting times are “physiologically” prolonged because of developmental deficiency of clotting proteins; plasma should be transfused only after reference to normal values is adjusted for the birthweight and age of the infant (not to normal ranges for older children and adults). The indications for plasma in neonates include (1) reconstitution of red blood cell (RBC) concentrates to simulate whole blood for use in massive trans- fusions (exchange transfusion, cardiac bypass surgery, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), (2) hemorrhage secondary to vitamin K defi- ciency, (3) disseminated intravascular coagulation with bleeding, and (4) bleeding in congenital coagulation factor deficiency when more specific treatment is either unavailable or inappropriate. The use of prophylactic plasma transfusion to prevent intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants is not recommended. Plasma should not be used as a suspending agent to adjust the hematocrit values of RBC concentrates before small-­ volume RBC transfusions to neonates because it offers no apparent medi- cal benefit over the use of sterile solutions such as crystalloid and albumin. Similarly, the use of plasma in partial exchange transfusion for the treat- ment of neonatal hyperviscosity syndrome is unnecessary because safer crystalloid or colloid solutions are available. In the treatment of bleeding infants, cryoprecipitate is often considered because of its small infusion volume. However, cryoprecipitate contains significant quantities of only fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and factors VIII and XIII. Thus it is not effective for treating the usual clinical situa- tion in bleeding infants with multiple clotting factor deficiencies. However, cryoprecipitate is an excellent source of fibrinogen (much more concen- trated than frozen plasma), and with a dose of 1–2 units/kg, the patient’s fibrinogen level can be quickly raised by 60–­100 mg/dL. In preliminary studies, infusions of very small volumes of recombi- nant activated factor VII have been lifesaving in patients with hemor- rhage caused by several mechanisms. Because the efficacy and toxicity of factor VIIa have not been fully defined in these “off-­label” uses (not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), it must be con- sidered “experimental” therapy at this time.

Misidentification is usually a result of mistakes made in labeling the patient's blood sample sent to the blood bank or not accurately matching the unit with the patient at the bedside when the blood is transfused. This risk is particularly high for infants, especially if ABO type-­specific or type-­compatible blood is transfused, because (1) identification bands may not be attached directly to their bodies, (2) difficulties in drawing blood samples for pretransfusion compatibility testing may lead to deviations from usual policies, and (3) infants cannot speak to identify themselves. Thus par- ticular care must be taken to ensure accurate patient and blood sample identification. INFECTIOUS RISKS OF TRANSFUSION Although the infectious disease risks of allogeneic blood transfusions are extremely low, transfusions must be given judiciously because “emerging infections,” such as Ebola or Zika virus, when they first arise, pose a potential threat until they are studied definitively and, accordingly, are of constant concern, and testing is not done for every microorganism possibly transmitted by blood transfusions (Table 523.1 and Fig. 523.1). Taking nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) and all other donor-­screening activities (antibody and epidemiology screening) into account, a current estimate of the risk of transfusion-­ associated HIV infection is approximately 1 per every 2 million donor exposures. Similarly, with NAT, the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is 1 per every 1.5-­2 million donor exposures (see Table 523.1). NAT identifies circulating microbial nucleic acids that appear in the window before antibodies develop, and NAT is used routinely to detect HIV, HCV, West Nile virus, hepatitis B virus, Trypanosoma cruzi, Babe- sia microti, and Zika virus. Transfusion-­associated cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been nearly eliminated by transfusion of leukocyte-­reduced cellular blood prod- ucts or by selection of blood collected from donors who are seronega- tive for antibody to CMV. Although it is logical to hypothesize that first collecting blood components from CMV-­seronegative donors and then removing the white blood cells (WBCs) might further improve safety, little data are available to document the superior efficacy of this combined approach. However, in a recent prospective birth cohort study of premature infants with birthweight ≤1,500 g, a combined approach of leukoreduction and CMV-­seronegative cellular blood components yielded 0% transfusion transmission of CMV (15.3% cumulative incidence at 12 weeks of maternal breast milk transmission from CMV-­seropositive mothers) in >300 transfused infants studied. Similar uncontrolled reports of hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients found 0% transmission of CMV from leukoreduced blood products from donors of unknown CMV antibody status. Therefore considerable care must be taken not to place children at risk of delayed or missed transfusions while awaiting/searching for blood from CMV-­ seronegative donors, then to leukoreduce (i.e., risks must not be taken for practices with no established benefits). Further data on these two mitigation strategies revealed that large quantities of CMV viral material are present “free” in the plasma of healthy-­appearing donors during the early phase of primary infec- tion (while CMV antibodies are either absent [“window” phase] or are newly emerging and at low, inconsistently detected levels in plasma), rather than being leukocyte associated, as occurs with CMV as sub- stantial quantities of IgG antibodies appear. As a result of this biology of CMV primary infection, plasma “free” virus will not be removed by leukoreduction during early infection, and CMV-­seronegative donors who may be asymptomatic or deny symptoms of infection during blood donor screening will be misclassified as being CMV safe. They are not necessarily as safe because antibody is below the limits of detection, while plasma “free” CMV is plentiful during early infection. Because almost all plasma “free” CMV disappears and becomes almost exclu- sively cell associated, once donors are CMV seropositive with antibody present for several months, some propose that the best method to reduce CMV risk may be leukoreduction of blood from donors known to be CMV seropositive for at least 1 year. However, data to prove the efficacy of this proposal are lacking, and in practice, several studies have shown that the most efficacious method currently available to pre- vent transfusion-­transmitted CMV is to perform leukoreduction in the Chapter 523 Risks of Blood Transfusions Patricia E.

Chapter 523  u  Risks of Blood Transfusions  3021 blood center/bank without regard for the CMV antibody status of the donor/unit (i.e., leukoreduction alone performed by the blood center/ bank, not at the bedside, is sufficient in most cases). Additional infectious risks include other types of hepatitis (A, B, E) and retroviruses (human T-­cell lymphotropic virus types I and II, HIV-­2), syphilis, parvovirus B19, Epstein-­Barr virus, human her- pesvirus 8, West Nile virus, yellow fever vaccine virus, malaria, babe- siosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Chagas disease, and Zika virus. Variant Creutzfeldt-­Jacob disease has also been transmitted by blood transfusions in humans. All are reported very infrequently, but none- theless provide the rationale to transfuse only when true benefits are likely. NONINFECTIOUS RISKS OF TRANSFUSION Transfusion-­associated risks of a noninfectious nature that may occur include hemolytic and nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, circula- tory fluid overload, graft-­versus-­host disease (GVHD), electrolyte and acid-­base imbalances, iron overload if repeated red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are needed long term, increased susceptibility to oxidant damage, exposure to plasticizers, hemolysis with T-­antigen activation of RBCs, posttransfusion purpura, transfusion-­related acute lung injury (TRALI), posttransfusion immunosuppression and immunomodula- tion, and alloimmunization (Fig. 523.2; see Table 523.1). The risk of TRALI may be reduced by avoiding transfusion of plasma or platelets from female donors, who were possibly alloimmunized to leukocyte antigens during pregnancy or by selecting donors (e.g., males) who are likely to be negative for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. Immunologic adverse effects, including immunosuppression, immunomodulation, and alloimmunization, may be reduced by leu- koreduction. Transfusion reactions and alloimmunization to RBC and leukocyte antigens seem to be uncommon in infants, perhaps because of developmental immaturity of the immune system or deficient cyto- kine production. When they do occur, adverse effects are seen primar- ily in massive transfusion settings, such as exchange transfusions and trauma or surgery, in which relatively large quantities of blood com- ponents are needed but are rare when small-­volume transfusions are usually given. Premature infants are known to have immune dysfunction, but their relative risk of posttransfusion GVHD is controversial. The postnatal age of the infant, the number of immunocompetent lym- phocytes in the transfusion product, the degree of HLA compatibility between donor and recipient, and other, poorly described phenom- ena determine which infants are truly at risk for GVHD. Regardless, many centers caring for preterm infants transfuse exclusively irradi- ated cellular products. As an alternative, pathogen-­reduction tech- nology has been documented to prevent GVHD and can substitute for irradiation. Directed donations with blood drawn from blood relatives must always be irradiated because of the risk of engraftment with transfused HLA-­homozygous, haploidentical lymphocytes. Cel- lular blood products given as intrauterine or exchange transfusions should be irradiated, as should transfusions for patients with severe congenital immunodeficiency disorders (severe combined immuno- deficiency syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome requiring heart sur- gery) and transfusions for recipients of hematopoietic progenitor cell transplants. Other groups who are potentially at risk but for whom no conclusive data are available include patients given T-­cell anti- body therapy (antithymocyte globulin or OKT3), those with organ allografts, those receiving immunosuppressive drug regimens, and those infected with HIV. As an alternative, pathogen-­reduction technology has been docu- mented to prevent T-­cell proliferation, and thus TA-­GVHD may be used as a substitute for irradiation. Current practice uses irradiation from a cesium, cobalt, or linear acceleration source at doses ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 centigray (cGy); a maximum dose of 2,500 cGy is required to hit the center of the irradiation field and a minimum of 1,500 cGy delivered to any other portion of the cannister. All cellular blood components should be irradiated, except those frozen without a cryoprotectant agent and to be rendered as “acellular” products, such as plasma and cryoprecipitate, which do not require irradiation. Leuko- cyte reduction cannot be substituted for irradiation to prevent GVHD. However, as mentioned, pathogen-­reduction technologies have been demonstrated to be efficacious.

An initial platelet plug (primary hemostasis) is bolstered by the product of the coagulation cascade: a factor XIII-­cross-­linked fibrin clot (secondary hemostasis). Extraneous fibrin is lysed by plas- min (fibrinolysis), and normal blood flow is restored through the pre- viously damaged vessel. If hemostasis is impaired, varying degrees of bleeding may occur depending on the hemostatic defect and the site of injury. Excess coagulation activity can lead to thrombotic complica- tions. The hemostatic response therefore needs to be rapid and locally regulated, such that trauma neither results in hemorrhage nor triggers a systemic thrombotic reaction. When a platelet adheres to a site of vas- cular injury, the activated platelet surface provides a phospholipid reac- tion surface where clotting factors bind and create a “thrombin burst.” Active clotting is controlled by negative feedback loops that inhibit the clotting process when procoagulant products come in contact with intact endothelium. The main components of the hemostatic process are the vessel wall, platelets, coagulation factors, anticoagulant pro- teins, and fibrinolytic system. Many components of the hemostasis system are multifunctional. Fibrinogen serves as the ligand between platelets during platelet aggregation and as the substrate for thrombin to produce fibrin. Platelets provide the reaction surface on which clot- ting reactions occur, form the plug at the site of vessel injury, release procoagulant compounds from their granules, and contract to con- strict and limit clot size. THE HEMOSTATIC PROCESS The intact vascular endothelium is the primary barrier against hemor- rhage and thrombosis. The endothelial cells that line the vessel wall normally inhibit coagulation and provide a smooth surface that per- mits rapid blood flow. After vascular injury, vasoconstriction occurs, and flowing blood comes in contact with the subendothelial matrix. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) tethers platelets to the site of injury by binding suben- dothelial matrix components such as collagen and platelets, via the gly- coprotein Ib complex on platelet membranes. Platelet binding of VWF initiates complex cellular signaling, activating the platelets and trig- gering secretion of storage granules containing adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin, and stored plasma and platelet membrane proteins. On activation, the platelet receptor for fibrinogen, αIIbβ3, is switched on (“inside out” signaling) to bind fibrinogen and triggers the aggrega- tion and recruitment of other platelets to form the platelet plug. Multi- ple physiologic agonists can trigger platelet activation and aggregation, including ADP, collagen, thrombin, and arachidonic acid. Aggregation involves the interaction of specific receptors on the platelet surface with plasma hemostatic proteins, primarily fibrinogen. One of the subendothelial matrix proteins that is exposed after vas- cular injury is tissue factor. Exposed tissue factor binds to factor VII Chapter 524 Hemostasis Brian R. Branchford, Benjamin J. Samelson-­ Jones, Leslie J. Raffini, and Veronica H. Flood Section 7 Hemorrhagic and Thrombotic Diseases and activates the clotting cascade (Fig. 524.1). The activated clotting factor then initiates the activation of the next sequential clotting factor in a systematic manner. During the process of platelet activation, inter- nalized platelet phospholipids (primarily phosphatidylserine) become externalized supporting membrane binding of the principal enzyme complexes of coagulation: the extrinsic and intrinsic Xase complexes and the prothrombinase complex. These complexes are localized to the platelet surface and bring together the active proteolytic enzyme, an activated cofactor, and the zymogen substrate that will form the next active enzyme in the cascade. This sequence of the coagulation cascade serves as a biochemical amplifier where a small amount of activated proteolytic enzyme can rapidly produce a large amount of downstream components, in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. In vivo, small amounts of activated factor VII (VIIa) are present, so the system is always poised to act. Near the bottom of the cascade, the multipotent enzyme thrombin is formed. Thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin, activates factors V, VIII, and XI, and aggregates platelets. Activation of factor XI by thrombin amplifies further thrombin generation and contributes to inhibition of fibrinolysis. Thrombin also activates factor XIII. The stable fibrin-­platelet plug is ultimately formed through clot retraction and cross linking of the fibrin clot by factor XIIIa. Virtually all procoagulant proteins are balanced by anticoagulant proteins that regulate or inhibit procoagulant function. Four clinically important, naturally occurring anticoagulants regulate the extension of the clotting process: antithrombin (AT), protein C, protein S, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). AT is a serine protease inhibi- tor (SERPIN) that regulates primarily factor Xa and thrombin and to a lesser extent, factors IXa, XIa, and XIIa. When thrombin encounters intact endothelium, thrombin binds to thrombomodulin, its endothelial receptor. The thrombin-­thrombomodulin complex then converts pro- tein C into activated protein C. In the presence of the cofactor protein S, activated protein C proteolyzes and inactivates factor Va and fac- tor VIIIa. Inactivated factor Va is also a functional anticoagulant that inhibits clotting. TFPI limits activation of factor X by factor VIIa and tissue factor and shifts the activation site of tissue factor and factor VIIa to that of factor IX (Fig. 524.2). Once a stable fibrin-­platelet plug is formed, the fibrinolytic system limits its extension and proteolyzes the clot (fibrinolysis) to reestab- lish vascular integrity. Plasmin, generated from plasminogen by either urokinase-­like or tissue-­type plasminogen activator, degrades the fibrin clot. In the process of dissolving the fibrin clot, fibrin degrada- tion products are produced. The fibrinolytic pathway is regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitors and α2-­antiplasmin, as well as by the thrombin-­activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). PATHOLOGY Congenital deficiency of an individual procoagulant protein leads to a bleeding disorder, whereas deficiency of an anticoagulant (clotting factor inhibitor) predisposes the patient to thrombosis. In acquired hemostatic disorders, there are frequently multiple problems with homeostasis that perturb and dysregulate hemostasis. A primary illness (sepsis) and its secondary effects (shock and acidosis) activate coagulation and fibrino- lysis and impair the host's ability to restore normal hemostatic function. When sepsis triggers disseminated intravascular coagulation, plate- lets, procoagulant clotting factors, and anticoagulant proteins are con- sumed, leaving the hemostatic system unbalanced and prone to bleeding or clotting (see Chapter 532). Similarly, newborn infants and patients with severe liver disease have synthetic deficiencies of both procoagu- lant and anticoagulant proteins. Such dysregulation causes the patient to be predisposed to both hemorrhage and thrombosis with mild or mod- erate triggers that result in major alterations in the hemostatic process. In the laboratory evaluation of hemostasis, parameters are manipu- lated to allow assessment of isolated aspects of hemostasis and limit the multifunctionality of some of its components. The coagulation process is studied in plasma anticoagulated with citrate to bind calcium, with added phospholipid to mimic the reaction surface normally provided by the platelet membrane and with a stimulus to trigger clotting. Cal- cium is added to restart the clotting process. This process does not nec- essarily reflect the in vivo pathways of clot formation.

Samelson-­Jones, Leslie J. Raffini, and Veronica H. Flood CLINICAL HISTORY For most hemostatic disorders, the clinical history provides the most useful information. To evaluate for a bleeding disorder, the history should determine the sites of bleeding, the severity and duration of hemorrhage, and the age at onset. Was the bleeding spontaneous, or did it occur after trauma? Was there a previous personal or family his- tory of similar problems? Did the symptoms correlate with the degree of injury or trauma? Does bruising occur spontaneously? Are there lumps with bruises for which there is minimal trauma? If the patient had previous surgery or significant dental procedures, was there any increased bleeding? If a child or adolescent has had surgery that affects the mucosal surfaces, such as a tonsillectomy or major dental extrac- tions, the absence of bleeding usually rules out a hereditary bleeding disorder. Delayed or slow healing of superficial injuries may suggest a hereditary bleeding disorder. In postpubertal females, it is important to take a careful menstrual history. Because some common bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease (VWD), have a fairly high prevalence, mothers and family members may have the same mild bleeding disorder and may not be cognizant that the child’s menstrual history is abnormal. Females with mild VWD who have a moderate history of bruising frequently have a reduction in symptoms during pregnancy or after administration of oral contraceptives. Some medi- cations, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), inhibit platelet function and increase bleeding symptoms in patients with a low platelet count or abnormal hemostasis. Standard- ized bleeding scores have been developed but have not been widely adopted in pediatrics. Outside the neonatal period, thrombotic disorders are relatively rare until adulthood. In the neonate, physiologic deficiencies of procoagu- lants and anticoagulants place the hemostatic mechanism at greater risk for imbalance, and clinical events can lead to either hemorrhage or thrombosis.

Many of the factors (F) are activated by the clotting factors shown above them in the cascade. The activated factors are designated by the addition of an a. On the right side, the major anticoagulants and the sites that they regulate are shown. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) regulates tissue factor (TF); factor VIIa, protein C, and protein S (P-­C/S) regulate factors VIII and V; and antithrombin III (AT-­III) regulates factor Xa and thrombin (factor IIa). The dotted line shows that, in vivo, TF and factor VIIa activate both factors IX and X, but that, in vitro, only the activation of factor X is measured. Unacti- vated factor VIII, when bound to its carrier protein, von Willebrand fac- tor (VWF), is protected from protein C inactivation. When thrombin, or factor Xa activates factor VIII, it becomes unbound from VWF, at which point it can participate with factor IXa in the activation of factor X in the presence of phospholipid (PL) and Ca++ (the “tenase” complex). Factor XIIIa cross-­links the fibrin clot and thereby makes it more sta- ble. Prekallikrein, high-­molecular-­weight kininogen (HMWK), and factor XII are shown in purple because they do not have a physiologic role in coagulation, although they contribute to the clotting time in partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

Chapter 524  u  Hemostasis  3025 (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), a detailed family history must be obtained to evaluate for DVT, PE, myocardial infarction (MI), or cere- brovascular accident (stroke) in other family members. The presence of thrombosis, especially in the absence of a provoking agent in the child or teenager, should induce the clinician to take a careful family history and consider an evaluation for a hereditary or acquired predisposition to thrombosis. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The physical examination should focus on whether bleeding symptoms are associated primarily with the mucous membranes or skin (mucocu- taneous bleeding) or with the muscles and joints (deep bleeding). The examination should determine the presence of petechiae, ecchymoses, hematomas, hemarthroses, or mucous membrane bleeding. Patients with defects in platelet–blood vessel wall interaction (VWD or platelet function defects) usually have mucocutaneous bleeding, which may include epistaxis, menorrhagia, petechiae, ecchymoses, occasional hematomas, and less frequently, hematuria and gastrointestinal bleed- ing. Individuals with a clotting deficiency of factor VIII or IX (hemo- philia A or B) have symptoms of deep bleeding into muscles and joints, with much more extensive ecchymoses and hematoma formation. Patients with mild VWD or other mild bleeding disorders may have no abnormal findings on physical examination. Individuals with disorders of the collagen matrix and vessel wall may have loose joints and lax skin associated with easy bruising (Ehlers-­Danlos syndrome). Patients undergoing evaluation for thrombotic disorders should be asked about swollen, warm, tender extremities (venous thrombo- sis), unexplained dyspnea or persistent “pneumonia,” especially in the absence of fever (PE), and skin changes suggestive of chronic throm- bosis (dilated collateral veins). Arterial thrombi usually cause an acute, dramatic impairment of organ function, such as stroke, MI, or a pain- ful, white, cold extremity (Table 524.1). LABORATORY TESTS In patients who have a positive bleeding history or who are actively hemorrhaging, a platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) should be performed as screening tests (Fig. 524.3). In individuals with abnormal screening tests, further evaluation should be based on those results (Table 524.2). In a patient with an abnormal bleeding history and a positive family history, nor- mal screening tests should not preclude further laboratory evaluation, which may include a thrombin time, VWF testing, and platelet func- tion studies. Historically, bleeding time and platelet function analysis (PFA-­100) have been used as screening tests, but neither has proved to be useful in diagnosis of mild bleeding disorders. There are no useful routine screening tests for hereditary throm- botic disorders. If the family history is positive or clinical thrombosis is unexplained, specific thrombophilia assays should be performed. Thrombosis is rare in children, and when it is present, the possibility of a hereditary predisposition should be considered (see Chapter 527). Platelet Count Platelet count is essential in the evaluation of the child with a posi- tive bleeding history because thrombocytopenia is the most com- mon acquired cause of a bleeding diathesis in children. Patients with a platelet count of >50 × 109/L rarely have significant clinical bleeding. Thrombocytosis in children is usually reactive and is not associated with bleeding complications. Persistent, severe thrombocytosis in the absence of an underlying illness may require evaluation for the very rare pediatric presentation of essential thrombocythemia or polycythe- mia vera. Prothrombin Time and Activated Partial Thrombo- plastin Time Because clotting (coagulation) factors were named in the order of dis- covery, they do not necessarily reflect the sequential order of activation (Table 524.3; see also Table 524.2). Only two factors have commonly used names: fibrinogen (factor I) and prothrombin (factor II). The dual mechanisms of activating clotting have been termed the intrinsic (surface activation) and extrinsic (tissue factor–mediated) pathways. PT measures the activation of clotting by tissue factor (thromboplas- tin) in the presence of calcium. The tissue factor–factor VIIa complex activates factor X. Whether factor X is activated by the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathway, factor Xa on the platelet phospholipid surface com- plexes with factor Va and calcium (the “prothrombinase” complex) to activate prothrombin to thrombin (also referred to as factor IIa). Once thrombin is generated, fibrinogen is converted to a fibrin clot, the end- point of the reaction (see Fig. 524.2). PT is not prolonged with deficien- cies of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. In most laboratories, the normal PT value is 10-­13 seconds. PT has been standardized using the interna- tional normalized ratio (INR) so that values can be compared from one laboratory or instrument to another. This ratio is used to determine similar degrees of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin. Partial Thromboplastin Time The intrinsic pathway involves the initial activation of factor XII, which is accelerated by two other plasma proteins, prekallikrein and high-­ molecular-­weight kininogen. In the clinical laboratory, factor XII is activated using a surface (silica or glass) or a contact activator, such as ellagic acid. Factor XIIa, in turn, activates factor XI to factor XIa, which then catalyzes factor IX to factor IXa. On the platelet phospholipid sur- face, factor IXa complexes with factor VIIIa and calcium to activate factor X (“tenase” complex). This process is accelerated by interaction with phospholipid and cal- cium at the steps involving factors V and VIII.

All rights reserved. 3026  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood a single clotting factor may result in isolated prolongation of PT, PTT, or both, depending on the location of the factor in the clotting cas- cade. This approach is useful in determining hereditary clotting factor deficiencies; however, in acquired hemostatic disorders encountered in clinical practice, more than one clotting factor is frequently deficient, so the relative prolongation of PT and PTT must be assessed. Measurement of PTT as performed in the clinical laboratory is actu- ally “activated” PTT; most refer to it as PTT. This test measures the initiation of clotting at the level of factor XII through sequential steps to the final clot endpoint. It does not measure factor VII, factor XIII, or anticoagulants. PTT uses a contact activator (silica, kaolin, or ellagic acid) in the presence of calcium and phospholipid. Because of differ- ences in reagents and laboratory instruments, the normal range for PTT varies among hospital laboratories. Normal ranges for PTT have much more interlaboratory variability than those for PT. Thus the mechanisms studied by PT and PTT allow the evaluation of clotting factor deficiencies, even though these pathways may not be the same as those occurring physiologically. The PTT can be prolonged by deficiencies of factor XII, prekallikrein, and high-­molecular-­weight kininogen, yet these deficiencies do not result in bleeding, Thrombin Time Thrombin time (TT) measures the final step in the clotting cascade, in which fibrinogen is converted to fibrin. The normal TT varies between laboratories but is usually 11-­15 seconds. Prolongation of TT occurs with reduced fibrinogen levels (hypofibrinogenemia or afibrinogen- emia), with dysfunctional fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenemia), or in the presence of substances that interfere with fibrin polymerization, such as heparin and fibrin split products. If heparin contamination is a potential cause of prolonged TT, a reptilase time can be ordered. Reptilase Time Reptilase time uses snake venom to clot fibrinogen. Unlike thrombin time, reptilase time is not sensitive to heparin and is prolonged only by reduced or dysfunctional fibrinogen and fibrin split products. There- fore, if TT is prolonged but reptilase time is normal, the prolonged TT is caused by heparin and does not indicate the presence of fibrin split products or reduced concentration or function of fibrinogen. Mixing Studies If there is unexplained prolongation of PT or PTT, a mixing study is usually performed. Normal plasma is added to the patient's plasma, and the PT or PTT is repeated. Correction of PT or PTT by 1:1 mixing with normal plasma suggests deficiency of a clotting factor because a 50% level of individual clotting proteins is sufficient to produce normal PT or PTT. If the clotting time is not corrected or only partially cor- rected, an inhibitor is usually present. An inhibitor of clotting may be either a chemical similar to heparin that delays coagulation or an Patient presents for laboratory investigation of bleeding Routine screening: PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, platelet count Consider von Willebrand testing for patients with appropriate history Isolated prolonged PT Assess factor VII Check for mild deficiency of: factors II, V and X Isolated prolonged aPTT Assess intrinsic pathway deficiencies: factors VIII, IX and XI von Willebrand testing Low fibrinogen Consider acquired causes (DIC, liver disease) If suspected dysfibrinogenemia: thrombin time, reptilase time and fibrinogen antigen Normal screening tests with high suspicion for bleeding disorder Perform second-line testing Low von Willebrand factor/activity or ratio Perform secondary von Willebrand testing as indicated (See discussion below) Prolonged PT and aPTT Assess common pathway deficiencies: factors II, V and X Assess acquired multiple factor deficiency Low factors V and VII Normal factor VIII Evaluate for liver disease Low factors V, VII and VIII* DIC Dilutional coagulopathy Platelet aggregation assay If abnormal, consider platelet glycoprotein studies or electron microscopy Fibrinolysis studies Consider testing for factor XIII, 2-antiplasmin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAl-1), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) Mild factor deficiencies Consider testing for mild factor deficiency, particularly factors VIII and IX Low factor VII Normal factors V and VIII Consider vitamin K deficiency - should correct with vitamin K therapy Fig. 524.3  Testing algorithm based on the screening tests (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count).

In the inpatient setting the most common cause of a prolonged PTT is heparin contamination of the sample. The presence of heparin in the sample can be ruled in or out by adding heparinase to the sample and repeating the PTT. If the mixing study is not corrected or if its result becomes more prolonged and the patient has clinical bleeding, an inhibitor of a specific clotting factor (antibody directed against the factor), most often factor VIII, factor IX, or factor XI, may be present. If the patient has no bleeding symptoms and both PTT and the mixing study are prolonged, a lupus-­like anticoagulant (see Chapter 531) is often present. Patients with these findings usually have a long PTT but do not bleed. Platelet Aggregation When a qualitative platelet function defect is suspected, platelet aggre- gation testing is usually ordered. Platelet-­rich plasma from the patient is activated with a series of agonists (ADP, epinephrine, collagen, thrombin or thrombin-­receptor peptide, and ristocetin). Some platelet aggregometers measure specific adenosine triphosphate release from the platelets, as measured by the generation of luminescence via lumi- aggregometry, and are more sensitive in detecting abnormalities of the platelet release reaction from storage granules. Repeat testing or test- ing of other symptomatic family members can help to determine the hereditary nature of the defect. Many medications, especially aspirin, other NSAIDs, and valproic acid, alter platelet function testing. Figure 524.1 provides an approach to the differential diagnosis of many com- mon bleeding disorders based on screening tests. Factor XIII The PT and PTT reflect only fibrin formation and do not measure cross-­linking by factor XIII. Therefore specific testing is required to identify factor XIII deficiency. Clot solubility testing can be performed but only identifies the most severely affected individuals. Quantitative measurement of factor XIII levels can also be performed.

Tests of the Fibrinolytic System Euglobulin clot lysis time is a screening test used in some laboratories to assess fibrinolysis. More specific tests are available in most laborato- ries to determine the levels of plasminogen, plasminogen activator, and inhibitors of fibrinolysis. An increase in fibrinolysis may be associated with hemorrhagic symptoms, and a delay in fibrinolysis is associated with thrombosis. DEVELOPMENTAL HEMOSTASIS The normal newborn infant has reduced plasma concentrations of sev- eral procoagulants and anticoagulants compared to adults (see Table 524.4), and this is even more pronounced in preterm infants. During gestation, there is progressive maturation and increase of the clot- ting factors synthesized by the liver. The extremely premature infant has prolonged PT and PTT values, as well as a marked reduction in anticoagulant protein levels (protein C, protein S, and AT). Levels of fibrinogen, factors V and VIII, VWF, and platelets are near-­normal throughout the later stages of gestation (see Chapter 142). Because protein C and protein S are physiologically reduced, factors V and VIII, which are present at normal levels at birth, are not balanced with their regulatory proteins. In contrast, the physiologic deficiency of vita- min K–dependent procoagulant proteins (factors II, VII, IX, and X) is partially balanced by the physiologic reduction of AT. The net effect is that newborns (especially premature infants) are at increased risk for complications of bleeding, clotting, or both. Establishing absolute cutoff values for normal ranges of coagulation proteins in newborn and preterm infants is challenging because of the age-­dependent variation and heterogeneity among laboratory instruments and reagents. Repeat testing (or testing parents) may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of an inherited deficiency. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Chapter 525  u  Hereditary Clotting Factor Deficiencies (Bleeding Disorders)  3029 Inherited deficiencies in the coagulation factors responsible for forming cross-­linked fibrin clots (as detailed in Chapter 524) can result in bleed- ing disorders. Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) are the most common and serious congenital coagulation factor deficiencies. The clinical findings in hemophilia A and hemophilia B are virtually identical. Factor XI deficiency is a rare autosomal bleeding disorder discussed in Chapter 525.2. Reduced lev- els of the contact factors (factor XII, high molecular weight kininogen, and prekallikrein) are associated with significant prolongation of acti- vated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; also referred to as PTT) but are not associated with clinical bleeding, as discussed in Chapter 525.3. 525.1  Factor VIII or Factor IX Deficiency (Hemophilia A or B) Benjamin J. Samelson-­Jones, Brian R. Branchford, and Veronica H. Flood Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) are the most common severe inherited bleeding disorders. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The activated forms of factors VIII and IX participate in the enzyme complex responsible for the sustained proteolytic activation of factor X during coagulation. Together with phospholipids and calcium, they form the intrinsic tenase (or factor X activating) complex. Hemophilia A and hemophilia B have similar clinical manifestations because, molecularly, both disorders result in a deficiency of factor X activation, which, in turn, results in insufficient thrombin generation (see Fig. 524.1 in Chapter 524 for a depiction of the in vitro clotting process as it occurs in the test tube). In hemostatically normal individuals, hemor- rhage after an injury is constrained by the initial formation of the plate- let plug, which is stabilized by the generation of a cross-­linked fibrin clot. In people with hemophilia A or B, clot formation is delayed and ineffectual. Inadequate thrombin production leads to failure to form a tightly cross-­linked fibrin to support the platelet plug. When untreated bleeding occurs in a closed space, such as a joint, bleeding may stop as the result of tamponade. With open wounds, in which tamponade can- not occur, even minor injuries may result in significant blood loss, with a highly friable clot forming slowly; rebleeding occurs during physi- ologic thrombolysis or with minimal new traumas. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS The severity of the bleeding phenotype in hemophilia A and B is strongly associated with the amount of residual factor VIII or factor IX, respectively. Severe hemophilia is characterized by having <1% normal factor activity, and bleeding is frequent and often spontaneous. Patients with moderate hemophilia have factor levels of 1–5% normal and bleed excessively with mild trauma. Individuals with mild hemo- philia have factor levels 5–40% normal and usually only bleed abnor- mally after major trauma or surgery; people with mild hemophilia may go many years before the condition is diagnosed. Because neither factor VIII nor factor IX crosses the placenta, bleed- ing symptoms may be present at birth. Between 1% and 4% of neonates with hemophilia have intracranial hemorrhages, mostly from birth trauma. However, about 35% and 70% of male infants with severe and nonsevere hemophilia, respectively, do not bleed with circumcision. Thus, in the absence of a positive family history (50% of cases), hemo- philia may go undiagnosed in the newborn period. Obvious symptoms, such as easy bruising, intramuscular hematomas, and hemarthroses, begin when the child starts to cruise. Bleeding from minor traumatic lacerations of the mouth (torn frenulum) may persist for hours or days and may cause the parents to seek medical evaluation. Even in patients with severe hemophilia, only 90% have evidence of increased bleeding by a year of age. Although bleeding may occur in any area of the body, the hallmark of hemophilia bleeding is hemarthrosis, which can occur spontane- ously or after minor trauma. The earliest joint hemorrhages appear most often in the ankles. In the older child and adolescent, hemarthro- ses of the knees and elbows are also common. Whereas the child’s early joint hemorrhages are recognized only after major swelling and fluid accumulation in the joint space, older children are frequently able to recognize bleeding before the physician does: patients report a warm, tingling sensation in the affected joint as the first sign of a joint hemor- rhage. Repeated bleeding episodes into the same joint may result in a “target” joint, which becomes more susceptible to recurrent bleeding because of the pathologic changes (see “Chronic Complications”). Although most muscular hemorrhages are clinically evident because of localized pain or swelling, bleeding into the iliopsoas muscle requires specific mention. A patient may lose large volumes of blood into the iliopsoas muscle, verging on hypovolemic shock, with only a vague area of referred pain in the groin. The hip is held in a flexed, internally rotated position because of irritation of the iliopsoas. The diagnosis is made clinically from the inability to extend the hip but should be confirmed with ultrasonography, CT, or MRI (Fig. 525.1). Life-­threatening bleeding in the patient with hemophilia is caused by bleeding into vital structures (central nervous system [CNS], upper air- way) or by exsanguination (external trauma, gastrointestinal [GI] or ilio- psoas hemorrhage). Prompt treatment with clotting factor concentrate for these life-­threatening hemorrhages is imperative. If head trauma is of sufficient concern to suggest radiologic evaluation, factor replace- ment should precede radiologic evaluation. Life-­threatening hemor- rhages require replacement therapy to achieve a level equal to that of normal plasma (100 IU/dL or 100%; see section below on “Treatment”). LABORATORY FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS A reduced level of factor VIII or factor IX will often result in a prolonged PTT. In severe hemophilia, the PTT value is usually 2-­3 times the upper limit of normal. However, depending on the PTT reagents, people with mild hemophilia can have a PTT in the normal range. Results of the other screening tests of the hemostatic mechanism (platelet count, bleeding time, prothrombin time [PT]) are normal. The specific activ- ity assays for factors VIII and IX confirm the diagnosis of hemophilia. One IU of each factor activity is defined as that amount in 1 mL of normal plasma, referenced against a standard established by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus 100 mL of normal plasma has 100 IU/dL (100% normal activity) of each factor. The term % activity refers to the percentage found in normal plasma (100% activity). Factor con- centrates are also referenced against an international WHO standard, so treatment doses are usually referred to in IU. In the newborn period, factor VIII activity values may be artificially elevated because of the acute-­phase response elicited by the birth pro- cess. This artificial elevation may cause an infant with mild hemophilia A to have a normal or near-­normal measured level. Patients with severe hemophilia A do not have detectable levels of factor VIII. In contrast, factor IX levels are physiologically low in all newborns and only reach adult values at about 6 months of age. If severe hemophilia is present in the family, an undetectable level of factor IX is diagnostic of severe hemophilia B. In some patients with mild factor IX deficiency, the presence of low factor IX activity can be confirmed only after several months of life.

An inhibitor titer can be quantified by the Bethesda assay, where 1 Bethesda Unit (BU) neutralizes 1 IU/mL of factor. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS In young infants with severe bleeding manifestations, the differential diagnosis includes severe thrombocytopenia; severe platelet function disorders, such as Bernard-­Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann throm- basthenia; type 3 (severe) von Willebrand disease; and vitamin K deficiency. GENETICS The genes for factor VIII and IX (F8 and F9, respectively) are car- ried near the terminus of the long arm of the X chromosome, making hemophilia an X-­linked disorder. It occurs in approximately 1/5,000 males, with 80% having factor VIII deficiency and 20% having factor IX deficiency. Hemophilia appears in all ethnic groups. A third of cases are estimated to be the result of a spontaneous pathogenic variant. Approximately 50% of cases of severe hemophilia A have a specific F8 change, in which there is an internal inversion within the factor VIII gene (intron 22 inversion). Meanwhile, 98% of hemophilia patients have an identified genetic cause of their hemophilia, which can facili- tate diagnosis, prenatal testing, and identification of female carriers. Some female carriers (heterozygotes) have sufficiently low factor level to have abnormal bleeding. Factor levels should be determined in all known or potential carriers to assess the need for treatment in the event of surgery or clinical bleeding. Female carriers with factor levels <40% normal are considered to have hemophilia and should be treated as such. Notably, about 0.2% of people with severe and moderate hemo- philia are female, mostly because of skewed lyonization or Turner syn- drome. Female carriers with factor levels >40% normal can also have abnormal bleeding and are termed symptomatic hemophilia carriers. Historically, female carriers were thought to be asymptomatic, but newer data prove these individuals can also have significant bleeding. TREATMENT Disease-­specific therapy started early in life is the hallmark of excel- lent hemophilia care (Table 525.1). Treatment can be divided into on-­demand therapy (hemostatic interventions to stop bleeding) and prophylaxis therapy to prevent bleeding. Prophylaxis is the standard of care for children with severe hemophilia in countries with sufficient medical resources. Prophylaxis decreases catastrophic bleeding, pre- vents hemarthrosis, and preserves joint health. The types of hemo- static agents available for hemophilia A and hemophilia B are rapidly expanding, with several new classes of medications receiving regula- tory approval (Table 525.2). On-­Demand Treatment To treat acute bleeding, nothing works better than replacing the defi- cient coagulation factor. When mild to moderate bleeding occurs, values of factor VIII or factor IX must be raised to hemostatic levels, approximately 50% of normal activity. For life-­threatening or major hemorrhages, the dose should aim to achieve levels of 100% activ- ity. Both plasma-­derived and recombinant factor VIII and factor IX concentrates are available. Replacement therapy requires intravenous administration, which patients and families often learn to do them- selves. The half-­lives of standard factor VIII and factor IX are 8-­12 hours and 18-­24 hours, respectively, although there is wide variabil- ity between patients with younger children often having shorter half-­ lives. There are also bioengineered factor VIII and factor IX products designed to have longer half-­lives (termed extended half-­life products), which reduce the frequency of intravenous administrations necessary to treat bleeds and provide prophylaxis. Table 525.1 summarizes the treatment recommendations of some common types of hemorrhage in a patient with hemophilia. The cal- culation of the factor replacement dose is as follows, with the differ- ence between factor VIII and factor IX being because of their different volumes of distribution: Factor VIII dose (IU) = [ % desired raise] × [weight (kg)] × 0.5 Factor IX dose (IU) = [ % desired raise] × [weight (kg)] × 1.3 Therefore emergency dosing for factor VIII deficiency is approxi- mately 50 units per kg and emergency dosing for factor IX deficiency is approximately 100-­130 units/kg. It is important to note that patients can have variable recoveries, and different factor products also have slightly different recoveries. Many patients will carry dosing cards detailing their recommended treat- ments. In general, doses are rounded up to vial size so as not to waste product. For some patients with mild factor VIII deficiency, desmopressin acetate can be used to stimulate the cellular release of endogenously A B C Fig. 525.1  Massive hematoma into the iliopsoas muscle in a patient with hemophilia B. A male with severe deficiency of factor IX (hemophilia B) was admitted for right lower abdominal pain of progressively increasing severity and tenderness. He had had a common cold with severe cough and loss of appetite for approximately 1 week. A, Abdominal radiograph shows presence of the psoas sign on the right side and left-­shifted colon gas. B, CT scan shows massive hematoma in the right iliopsoas muscle, resulting in anterior translocation of the right kidney. C, Reconstructed 3-­dimensional image shows more clearly the kidney translocation and the extended, but intact, large vessels. These are useful findings for the diagnostic procedures because progressive right lower abdominal pain may closely simulate acute appendicitis. The hemorrhage was successfully managed by replacement of factor IX for 1 week without any recurrence. The patient did not have any inhibitors to factor IX. (From Miyazaki K, Higashihara M.

In patients with mod- erate or severe factor VIII deficiency, the stored levels of factor VIII are inadequate, and desmopressin treatment is ineffective. Desmopressin can be administered intravenously or intranasally, with the latter facilitating home treatment. The intranasal formulation is a higher concentration of desmopressin than that used to treat enuresis or hypopituitarism; the dose is 150 μg (1 spray) for children weighing <50 kg and 300 μg (2 sprays) for children and young adults weighing >50 kg. Most centers adminis- ter a trial of desmopressin to determine if the factor VIII levels increase sufficiently for hemostasis. Because desmopressin triggers the release of cellularly stored factor VIII, usually it can only be given twice in a 1-­2 day period. The most serious complication is hyponatremia, which can be mitigated by fluid restrictions for the 24 hours after administration. Desmopressin is not effective in the treatment of factor IX deficiency. Mucosal bleeding often benefits from antifibrinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid that can be given orally or intravenously. PROPHYLAXIS Many patients are given lifelong prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous joint bleeding. The World Federation of Hemophilia recommends pro- phylaxis for children with severe hemophilia and for adults with joint disease. Usually, such programs are initiated at the time of the first or second joint hemorrhage. Young children often require the insertion of a central catheter to ensure venous access for factor replacements. Such regimens are expensive but highly effective in preventing or greatly limiting the degree of joint pathology; complications include central line infection and thrombosis. The goal of prophylaxis is generally to maintain a measurable plasma factor level (1–2%), when assayed just before the next infusion (trough level); this converts patients from severe to moderate hemophilia. For standard half-­life products, this typically requires intravenous admin- istration 2-­4 times per week; this frequency is reduced with prophy- laxis with extended half-­life products. Another class of hemophilia drugs that promotes hemostasis with- out factor VIII or factor IX is termed nonfactor therapies. Emici- zumab is approved for prophylaxis for hemophilia A. Emicizumab is a bispecific, humanized monoclonal antibody that can bridge activated factor IX and factor X to restore factor X activation. It is administered subcutaneously and is given only 1-­4 times per month after four weekly loading doses. Because emicizumab mimics some of the biochemistry of activated factor VIII, it dramatically shortens PTT times. It is not used to treat acute bleeds. Efanesoctocog alfa, a modified extended half-life single recombinant factor VIII protein that decouples recombinant factor VIII from endog- enous von Willebrand factor, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with severe hemophilia A.  Fitusiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that reduces antithrombin synthesis, has been used successfully for prophy- laxis in patients with hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. Gene therapy (valoctocogene roxaparvovec for hemophilia A; etranacogene dezaparvovec for hemophilia B) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing bleeding in adult patients with severe hemophilia. SUPPORTIVE CARE Effective measures to avoid trauma include anticipatory guidance, including the use of car seats, seatbelts, and bike helmets and the avoid- ance of high-­risk behaviors. Older males should be counseled to avoid violent contact sports, but this issue is admittedly a challenge; however, active lifestyles are also encouraged to limit obesity. Early psychosocial intervention helps the family achieve a balance between overprotec- tion and permissiveness. Patients with hemophilia should avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that affect platelet function. Inhibitor Formation The formation of neutralizing antibodies, termed inhibitors, is the major complication of factor VIII or factor IX replacement therapy. They develop in 20–30% of severe hemophilia A patients and 3–10% of severe hemophilia B patients that receive factor therapy, usually within 20 exposures to factor. Inhibitors may be identified during routine laboratory surveillance or become clinically apparent when bleeding episodes fail to respond to appropriate replacement therapy. There are both patient and product risk factors for inhibitor development, with the underlying hemophilia-­causing gene pathogenic variant being the most important with the majority of people with large-­gene deletions developing inhibitors. Prophylaxis with plasma-­derived factor VIII products decreases the risk of inhibitor development about 1.7-­fold compared to recombinant factor VIII products. Intensive early factor exposure during surgery or major trauma increases the risk of inhibitor development, likely through initiating immunologic danger signaling. Patients with inhibitors always require referral to a center that cares for many such patients and has a comprehensive hemophilia program. Clinically, inhibitor titers are demarcated as low-­titer (≤5 BU) and high-­titer (>5 BU). Low-­titer inhibitors can often be overcome by large amounts of factor, while high-­titers necessitate the use of bypassing agents, which can circumvent the inhibitor to promote hemostasis. The two bypassing agents available that can treat acute bleeds are activated prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant activated factor VII, both of which are administered intravenously. Prophylaxis regi- mens for bypassing agents have been described, but most hemophilia A patients with inhibitors currently use emicizumab prophylaxis because of its efficacy and ease of administration. Inhibitor eradication has been prioritized, and it is still recom- mended since the advent of emicizumab. Low-­titer or transient inhibi- tors often disappear with continued regular factor infusions. Higher titer inhibitors often require immune tolerance induction regimens, in which high doses of factor are administered to attempt to develop immune tolerance. This procedure is successful in about two-­thirds of severe hemophilia A patients. Immune tolerance induction with factor IX products is complicated by allergic reactions and the development of nephrotic syndrome in some patients. Rituximab, corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressives have been used in patients with high-­titer inhibitors in whom immune tolerance programs have failed, although the use of immunosuppressive therapy has declined with the use of emicizumab prophylaxis for factor VIII deficiency inhibitor patients. CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS Long-­term complications of hemophilia A and B include chronic arthropathy and the risk of transfusion-­transmitted infectious diseases, although both complications have been substantially mitigated with modern hemophilia care, including early initiation of prophylaxis and the use of recombinant protein products or plasma-­derived products with advanced donor screening and highly active viricidal procedures. Chronic arthropathy is the major long-­term disability associated with hemophilia. The natural history of severe hemophilia without prophylaxis is one of cyclic recurrent hemorrhages into specific joints, including hemorrhages into the same (target) joint. In young children, the joint distends easily, and a large volume of blood may fill the joint until tamponade ensues or therapy intervenes. After joint hemorrhage, proteolytic enzymes are released by white blood cells into the joint space, and heme iron induces macrophage proliferation, leading to inflamma- tion of the synovium. The synovium thickens and develops frondlike projections into the joint that are susceptible to being pinched and may induce further hemorrhage. The cartilaginous surface becomes eroded and ultimately may even expose raw bone, leaving the joint susceptible to articular fusion. In the older patient with advanced arthropathy, bleed- ing into the target joint, with its thickened synovium, causes severe pain, because the joint has little space to accommodate blood. Once a target joint develops, the patient is usually given short-­ or long-­term prophy- laxis to prevent progression of the arthropathy and reduce inflammation. In the past, plasma-­derived products tragically transmitted hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV to large numbers of people with hemo- philia. Modern plasma-­derived products pose a very low risk of spreading identified bloodborne pathogens, but the risk of transmitting unidentified pathogens or emerging agents such as prions remains largely undefined.

Such centers involve a team that includes physicians, nurses, ortho- pedists, physical therapists, and psychosocial workers, all focused on hemophilia care. Education remains crucial in hemophilia care because patients who are receiving prophylaxis may be less experienced in rec- ognizing bleeding episodes than affected children from previous eras.

Flood Factor XI deficiency (previously known as hemophilia C) is an auto- somal disorder associated with mild to moderate bleeding symptoms. Bleeding is usually after trauma and surgery, with bleeding most com- monly occurring at sites of high fibrinolytic activity, such as the oro- pharynx and urogenital tract. This focality is likely secondary to the role of factor XI in augmenting thrombin generation for the subsequent activation of thrombin-­activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). Heavy menstrual bleeding is also common in females with factor XI deficiency. Factor XI deficiency can occur in any ethnic group but is frequently encountered in Ashkenazi Jews with a heterozygous frequency of 1 in 11 individuals. Factor XI deficiency usually (but not always) results in a prolonged PTT; specific factor XI activity assays are diagnostic. The bleeding phenotype is poorly predicted by the measured fac- tor XI activity. Some patients with severe deficiency (<20% normal activity) may have minimal or no symptoms, whereas other individu- als with higher levels experience excessive surgical bleeding. Because spontaneous bleeding is very rare, treatment is focused on periop- erative management. Although factor XI concentrates are available in other countries, in the United States, factor XI has to be replaced with fresh-­frozen plasma (FFP). For minor surgeries or bleeds, antifibrinol- ytics such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are frequently used. For major surgeries, 15-­25 mL/kg of FFP in combination with antifibri- nolytics is recommended. The factor XI half-­life is 50 hours.

Branchford, and Veronica H. Flood Deficiency of the “contact factors”—factor XII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen—causes a prolonged PTT but no bleeding symptoms. Because these contact factors function at the step of initia- tion of the intrinsic clotting system by the reagent used to determine PTT, the PTT is markedly prolonged when these factors are absent. Thus there is the paradoxical situation in which PTT is extremely pro- longed with no evidence of clinical bleeding. It is important that indi- viduals with these findings be well informed about the meaning of their clotting factor deficiency because they do not need treatment, even for major surgery. 525.4  Factor VII Deficiency Benjamin J. Samelson-­Jones, Brian R. Branchford, and Veronica H. Flood Factor VII deficiency is a rare autosomal bleeding disorder that ranges in its presentation from mild to severe bleeding. There is a poor correlation between the clinical severity and the measured factor VII level, although major bleeding is more frequent in patients with <1% activity. Epistaxis and menorrhagia are the most common symptoms, although hemarthroses and intracranial hemorrhages also occur, with the latter reported in 1% of symptomatic cases. Patients with this deficiency have greatly prolonged PT but normal PTT. Specific factor VII assays are diagnostic. Some recombinant factor VIIa products are approved for the treatment of factor VII deficiency at a dose of 15-­30 mcg/kg, which is lower than the dose approved for hemophilia with inhibitors. The plasma half-­life of factor VII is 2-­6 hours and usually at least three doses at this frequency are required for major bleeding or surgery. Prophylaxis regimens with 2-­3 administra- tions per week have been described in patients with severe bleeding.

Flood Factor X deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with vari- able severity. Mild deficiency results in mucocutaneous and posttrau- matic bleeding, whereas severe deficiency (<1–10% normal activity) is associated with joint, GI, and intracranial hemorrhages. Intracranial and umbilical bleeding can be the presenting symptom for neonates. Heterozygous carriers usually have activity >50% normal and are asymptomatic. A reduced factor X level is associated with prolongation of both PT and PTT; factor X specific assays are diagnostic. Replacement treat- ment is with FFP or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or plasma-­derived factor X concentrates. The plasma half-­life of factor X is approximately 40-­60 hours, and prophylaxis regimens with PCC or factor X concentrates administered 1-­2 times per week are described for patients with severe bleeding. Although it is rarely a problem in pediatric patients, about 10% of cases of light-­chain amyloidosis are associated with factor X defi- ciency, resulting from the adsorption of factor X on the amyloid pro- tein. In the setting of amyloidosis, replacement therapy often is not successful because of the rapid clearance of factor X.

Flood Prothrombin (factor II) deficiency is caused either by a markedly reduced prothrombin level (hypoprothrombinemia) or by function- ally abnormal prothrombin (dysprothrombinemia). Laboratory testing in homozygous patients shows prolonged PT and PTT; specific pro- thrombin assays are diagnostic. Mucocutaneous bleeding in infancy and posttraumatic bleeding later are common. Patients are treated with either FFP or PCC at doses of 15-­25 mL/kg or 20-­40 U/kg, respectively. The half-­life of prothrombin is 3-­4 days, and once weekly prophylaxis regimens with PCC are reported. Acquired factor II deficiency can be seen with a small percentage of patients with a lupus anticoagulant and is usually associated with significant bleeding. It is distinguished from inherited prothrom- bin deficiency by clinical history and the laboratory identification of antiphospholipid antibodies and abnormal PTT mixing studies.

Flood Deficiency of factor V is an autosomal recessive, mild to moderate bleeding disorder. Factor V circulates with 80% in plasma and 20% in platelet α-­granules; this platelet factor V pool has been suggested to ameliorate the bleeding that might be expected from low plasma factor V levels. The most common symptoms are epistaxis, oral cavity bleeding, heavy menstrual periods, and postoperative bleeding; joint, muscle, and intracranial hemorrhages occur rarely. Laboratory evaluation shows prolonged PT and PTT. Specific assays for factor V show a reduction in factor V levels. FFP is the only cur- rently available therapeutic product that contains factor V. Factor V is lost rapidly from stored FFP. Treatment for major surgery or bleeding is usually 15-­25 mL/kg FFP followed by additional doses of 10 mL/kg every 12 hours. Twice weekly FFP prophylaxis regimens are sometimes used for patients with severe bleeding. Platelet transfusions are also an option for acute or prophylactic treatment. Rarely, a patient with a negative family history of bleeding has an acquired antibody to factor V, which can be identified in laboratory mixing studies.

Flood Combined deficiency of factors V and VIII is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder that occurs secondary to the absence of intracellular transporters responsible for the shuttling of factors V and VIII from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartments, as the result of pathogenic variants in the genes LMAN1 or MCFD2. Factor V and VIII levels are usually between 5–20% of normal. Bleeding symptoms are often mild and most commonly mucocutaneous, traumatic, surgical bleeding. Treatment for major bleeding or surgery is 15-­25 mL/kg of FFP. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 525.9  Congenital Fibrinogen Disorders Benjamin J. Samelson-­Jones, Brian R. Branchford, and Veronica H. Flood Congenital fibrinogen disorders are a heterogenous group of rare auto- somal recessive or dominant diseases because of qualitative (dysfibrino- genemia) or quantitative (hypofibrinogenemia or afibrinogenemia) reductions in functional fibrinogen. Fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin into fibrin is the final step of the coagulation cascade: polymerization follows cleavage and results in fibrin clot formation. Fibrinogen is also the major integrin ligand during platelet aggregation. Conversely, fibrin also seques- ters thrombin to the site of clot formation and supports fibrinolysis by enhancing the activation of plasminogen. The multiple roles of fibrinogen and fibrin in hemostasis underlie the phenotypes of inherited fibrinogen disorders, which can have bleeding and clotting clinical manifestations, sometimes in the same patient. The most common bleeding symptoms are mucocutaneous, soft-­tissue, joint, genitourinary, traumatic, surgical bleeding, and heavy menstrual periods. Both venous and arterial throm- bosis are rare in the quantitative defects but occur in about 20% of cases of dysfibrinogenemia. Some congenital fibrinogen disorders also have nonhematologic manifestations, including liver disease due to retention of misfolded protein, poor wound healing, and splenic rupture. Diagnosis is based on a decreased fibrinogen activity. Patients usu- ally will also have a prolonged PT and PTT. Dysfibrinogenemia is defined as a decreased ratio of fibrinogen activity compared to fibrino- gen antigen. Treatment for bleeding or major surgery is with FFP, cryo- precipitate, or fibrinogen concentrates, depending on local availability. Because of the variable clinical manifestations, including both bleeding and clotting complications, treatment is tailored to the personal and family history. The half-­life of fibrinogen is 2-­4 days.

Samelson-­Jones, Brian R. Branchford, and Veronica H. Flood Factor XIII deficiency is a rare autosomal bleeding disorder. Factor XIII is a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic A subunits and two car- rier B subunits; activation of factor XIII by thrombin frees the activated A subunits, which covalently crosslink fibrin to increase clot strength and constrain fibrinolysis. The different biochemical roles of the A and B subunits result in distinct clinical manifestations. Inherited deficien- cies in the factor XIII A-­subunit results in soft tissue, umbilical, surgical, joint, and intracranial bleeding; the latter occurs in about a third of cases. Deficiencies in the B-­subunit are associated with mild mucocutaneous and surgical bleeding. Because of its role in stabilizing the fibrin clot, factor XIII deficiency often presents with delayed abnormal bleeding or bruising symptoms where patients may have mild trauma and then pres- ent with an excessive hematoma on the following day. Extrahematologic clinical manifestation of factor XIII deficiency includes delayed umbili- cal cord separation, poor wound healing, and recurrent miscarriages. Unlike the other severe inherited coagulation deficiencies, factor XIII deficiency will have normal PTT and PT. Specific activity assays are diag- nostic and should be considered in infants with delayed umbilical cord separation, delayed bleeding symptoms, or unexplained intracranial hem- orrhage. Treatment for bleeding or major surgery is 20-­40 U/kg of fac- tor XIII concentrate. Recombinant A-­subunit protein is also available for A-­subunit deficiencies. If specific factor XIII replacement therapies are not available, cryoprecipitate is preferred over FFP because of the substantially higher factor XIII content. The half-­life of factor XIII is 9-­12 days, which facilitates prophylaxis. Because of the high prevalence of intracranial hem- orrhage, prophylaxis of 20-­40 U/kg factor XIII concentrate every 4 weeks is recommended for patients with <10% normal activity. Autoimmune acquired factor XIII deficiency can be differentiated using specific mixing studies or activity assays of platelet lysates.

Branchford, and Veronica H. Flood Deficiency of either antiplasmin or plasminogen activator inhibitor, both of which are antifibrinolytic proteins, results in increased plasmin generation and premature lysis of fibrin clots. Affected patients have a mild-­to-­moderate bleeding disorder characterized by delayed bleed- ing symptoms, typically associated with trauma or surgery. Mucocuta- neous bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding are the most described symptoms, with rare reports of joint or intracranial hemorrhages. Because results of the usual hemostatic tests are normal, further workup of a patient with a positive bleeding history (especially delayed bleed- ing) should include euglobulin clot lysis time, which measures fibrinolytic activity and yields a shortened result in the presence of these deficiencies. Specific assays for α2-­antiplasmin and plasminogen activator inhibitor are available, although the lower limit of normative values of these assays are not well defined. Antifibrinolytic therapies such as aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are the mainstay of treatments for controlling or prevent- ing bleeding because they mitigate the hyperfibrinolysis. FFP can also be used to replace the deficient proteins. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Chapter 526  u  Von Willebrand Disease  3035 Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleed- ing disorder, with an estimated prevalence cited at 1 : 100 to 1 : 10,000 depending on the criteria used for diagnosis. Patients with VWD typi- cally present with mucosal bleeding. A family history of either VWD or bleeding symptoms and confirmatory laboratory testing are also required for the diagnosis of VWD. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY VWD is caused by a defect in, or deficiency of, von Willebrand fac- tor (VWF). VWF has several functions in coagulation. VWF serves to tether platelets to injured subendothelium via binding sites for platelets and for collagen. VWF also serves as a chaperone, or carrier protein, for factor VIII (FVIII), protecting it from degradation in plasma. VWF is stored in endothelial cell Weibel-­Palade bodies and platelet dense granules and circulates as a large, multimeric glycoprotein. Shear stress induces a conformational change in VWF that facilitates its ability to bind platelets through an exposed binding site on platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). This enables VWF to recruit platelets to the site of clot for- mation, a function dependent on the high molecular weight (HMW) multimer forms of VWF. VWD typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding, similar to that seen with other platelet defects. Epistaxis, easy bruising, and menorrha- gia in females are common complaints. However, symptoms are variable and do not necessarily correlate well with VWF levels. Surgical bleed- ing, particularly with dental extractions or adenotonsillectomy, is another common presentation. Severe type 3 VWD may present with joint and/ or muscle bleeds. Most patients will have a family history of bleeding, but the VWD genetic variant demonstrates incomplete penetrance (not all carriers of the variant express bleeding symptoms) and variable expressiv- ity (different VWF levels can be found in individuals with the same gene variant). Females are more likely to be diagnosed with VWD because of the potential for symptoms with menorrhagia, but males and females are equally likely to have VWD. However, diagnosis based on symptoms may be difficult, since minor bruising and epistaxis are not uncommon in childhood. Significant unexplained bruising, or bruising in unusual areas (stomach, back, face), in infants and toddlers is more often from nonaccidental trauma than from an underlying bleeding disorder. Gas- trointestinal bleeding due to VWD may be complicated by associated angiodysplastic lesions anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. CLASSIFICATION VWD may be caused by quantitative or qualitative defects in VWF. Mild to moderate quantitative defects are classified as type 1 VWD, whereas severe quantitative defects, in which there is no detectable VWF protein, are classified as type 3 VWD. The qualitative defects are grouped together as type 2 VWD. Type 1 VWD is by far the most common type, accounting for 60–80% of all VWD patients. Typical symptoms include mucosal bleeding, such as epistaxis and menorrhagia, as well as easy bruising and potentially surgical bleeding. Diagnostic guidelines use a VWF level, as measured by the VWF antigen assay (VWF:Ag), of <30 IU/ dL for a clear diagnosis of VWD. Antigen and activity are usually sym- metrically depressed in type 1 VWD. Patients with VWF:Ag <30 IU/dL are most likely to have a genetic defect in VWF. Patients with VWF:Ag between 30 and 50 IU/dL are said to have “low VWF.” Whether or not this category truly represents VWD is a subject of some debate, and the joint guidelines suggest that the resolution should be based on presence or absence of bleeding symptoms. Because some patients with VWF levels in this range do experience bleeding, many physicians elect to treat them, especially perioperatively, for surgical procedures such as tonsillectomy. Patients with type 1 VWD may have low VWF as a result of increased clearance of their VWF, known as type 1C VWD. Diagnosis of this subtype is important because treatment of these patients with desmo- pressin is likely to be ineffective, necessitating administration of VWF-­ containing products instead. VWF levels can be influenced by external factors. Blood type has long been known to affect VWF, with lower VWF levels seen in people with blood group O. Stress, inflammation, exercise, menstrual cycle, and pregnancy all increase VWF levels; therefore a single normal VWF level does not necessarily rule out the presence of VWD. Certain diseases, such as hypothyroidism (see Chapter 603), and medications, such as valproic acid, can lower VWF levels in affected patients. Repeat testing is often required to confidently rule out or confirm a diagnosis of VWD. Type 3 VWD is the most severe form and presents with symptoms similar to those seen in mild hemophilia. In type 3 VWD the VWF protein is completely absent, and the activity and antigen are both essentially zero. Type 3 VWD is seen at a frequency of approximately 1/1,000,000 members of the general population. In addition to muco- sal bleeding, patients may experience joint bleeds, muscle bleeds, or central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage. Some physicians elect to treat patients with prophylaxis, or modified prophylaxis, after injury, given that these patients typically have very low FVIII (<10 IU/dL). Because type 3 VWD is caused by a complete lack of VWF, desmo- pressin is ineffective and treatment with VWF-­containing concentrates is required. Type 2 VWD is often suspected when a discrepancy exists between the VWF antigen level (often normal) and the VWF activity (often low) because this type represents a qualitative defect, in which an abnormal protein is produced in normal amounts. A ratio of activity to antigen of less than 0.7 may raise concern for type 2 VWD, which itself has mul- tiple subtypes. Multimer evaluation or other specialized testing can be used to discriminate the type 2 subtypes. Type 2A VWD is characterized by a defect in VWF multimeriza- tion and decreased VWF activity in terms of platelet binding. It is the most common of the type 2 variants, accounting for approximately 10% of VWD cases. Type 2A VWD can result from variants that affect multimer assembly and processing, or variants that result in increased proteolysis of secreted VWF. Some variants affect both secretion and clearance of the VWF. Regardless of the mechanism, all type 2A VWD patients lack the HMW multimers, and therefore have reduced VWF activity, which results in bleeding. Symptoms are typically more severe than those seen in type 1 VWD. Desmopressin may have clinical effi- cacy for treatment of minor bleeding, but significant surgical challenges or major bleeding symptoms generally require a VWF-­containing con- centrate for treatment. Type 2B VWD results from gain-­of-­function variants that increase the ability of VWF to bind platelets. This leads to increased clearance of both VWF and platelets from circulation and results in the loss of HMW multimers and decreased VWF activity, similar to that seen in type 2A VWD. Special testing is therefore required to diagnose type 2B VWD, either by direct measurement of the increased platelet binding or by an increased response to low dose ristocetin on platelet aggre- gation testing. Thrombocytopenia is not always present and may be more prominent during times of stress such as surgery or pregnancy. Desmopressin is relatively contraindicated in type 2B VWD because it may accelerate VWF-­platelet binding and clearance, so treatment with VWF-­containing product is necessary. Platelet-­type pseudo-­VWD occurs when a variant in platelet GPIb causes spontaneous binding to VWF and also presents with decreased VWF activity, loss of HMW multimers, and thrombocytopenia simi- lar to type 2B VWD. Specific testing is required to distinguish the two conditions. Because the defect involves platelets, treatment generally requires platelet transfusion. Type 2M VWD includes those patients with decreased VWF activity but normal (or near normal) multimer distribution. This is generally caused by a defect in the ability of VWF to bind platelet GPIb, but this category also includes patients with defects in VWF-­collagen interac- tions. Some minor bleeding in type 2M VWD may respond to desmopres- sin, but because type 2M VWD is a functional defect, treatment with VWF-­containing concentrates is usually required.

All rights reserved. 3036  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood Type 2N VWD is characterized by a defect in the ability of VWF to bind FVIII. Some patients with type 2N VWD may be misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia; therefore a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis is required in patients with low FVIII and an absent family history of FVIII deficiency. Because the VWF in this case is dysfunctional, desmo- pressin is not usually helpful, and VWF-­containing product infusion is typically required. LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS There are no reliable screening tests for VWD. Patients with significant bleeding may present with anemia, and some patients with type 2B VWD or platelet-­type pseudo-­VWD may have thrombocytopenia. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may be prolonged if FVIII is low but especially in type 1 VWD it is often normal, precluding use of the PTT as a screening test. Platelet function analysis has been considered as a screening test for VWD, but suboptimal sensitivity and specificity render results difficult to interpret. Bleeding times are similarly unreli- able in diagnosis of VWD. Unfortunately, no single test can reliably diagnose VWD; there- fore a panel of tests is usually required (Table 526.1). These include VWF:Ag, which measures the total amount of VWF protein present, and VWF activity test, typically using the ristocetin cofactor activity assay (VWF:RCo), which provides a measure of the amount of func- tional VWF. FVIII activity is also usually included in the workup. Another test measures VWF binding to platelet GPIb without risto- cetin (VWF:GPIbM). This test is now FDA approved and its use is increasing. Collagen binding measures an additional function of VWF. Multimer distribution provides an assessment of HMW multimers (Table 526.2; Fig. 526.1). Additional specialized testing may be employed to help determine the correct diagnosis. Specific testing for type 1C (clearance defects), type 2B, and type 2N VWD can confirm these diagnoses. Genetic diag- nosis is not typically performed, partly because of the large size of the VWF gene and the high number of benign sequence variations. Large gene deletions are responsible for some cases of VWD and will not be detected on routine DNA sequencing. However, use of genetic diagno- sis is increasing, particularly for types 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N VWD. TREATMENT Treatment of VWD depends on the type of VWD present and the rea- son for treatment (Table 526.3). In general, type 1 VWD patients may be treated with desmopressin, which increases the amount of circu- lating VWF (and FVIII) by release from storage in endothelial cells. The exceptions are the rare type 1 patient who lacks a response to desmopressin and patients with type 1C VWD who do respond with an increase in VWF levels, but whose rapid clearance of circulating endogenous VWF results in a rapid return to baseline levels. Treat- ment of types 2 and 3 VWD requires VWF-­containing concentrates, similar to the treatment of hemophilia. Dosing depends on the type of VWD and the reason for treatment. Careful monitoring of VWF and FVIII levels is recommended to tailor treatment for surgeries and major trauma. For all types of VWD, adjunct therapy should be consid- ered when possible, such as the use of antifibrinolytics for oral surgery or hormonal treatment for menorrhagia. Alternate treatment strategies should also be considered, particularly for difficult symptoms or severe VWD. Hormonal therapy for females with menorrhagia, although not specific to VWD, can be very helpful in managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Local treatment of epistaxis, such as nasal cautery or packing, may be helpful in some circumstances. Iron therapy for patients with iron-­deficiency anemia may also be required.

The strength of the inherited prothrombotic risk factors varies. An estimated 30–60% of individuals with strong thrombophilias, such as antithrombin defi- ciency, protein C deficiency, and protein S deficiency, develop throm- boembolic disease by age 60; in contrast, less than 10% of individuals with weak thrombophilias, such as heterozygous factor V Leiden vari- ant or prothrombin G20210A gene variant, develop thromboembolic disease. The inherited thrombophilias with the best understood patho- genesis, population prevalence, and prothrombotic risks are listed in Table 527.1. Some of these disorders may also be acquired or mixed acquired and genetic (Table 527.2). The inheritance of other thrombophilias is less well understood. Elevated levels of factor VIII (FVIII) and homocysteine are associ- ated with thrombosis, but their levels are not necessarily genetically determined. Additional alterations in plasma proteins have also been associated with increased thrombotic risk, such as elevated concen- trations of factors IX and XI, heparin cofactor II deficiency, elevated lipoprotein (a), and dysfibrinogenemia; however, these abnormalities have not gained widespread acceptance in routine testing of children for inherited thrombophilia. In general, the prothrombotic tendency conferred by these defects is either a result of an increased procoagulant effect (prothrombin gene pathogenic variant, elevated FVIII, hyperhomocysteinemia) or a decreased anticoagulant effect (factor V Leiden, deficiency of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin). Although numerous inherited risk fac- tors for thrombosis have been identified, the majority of individuals who inherit one of these risk factors, even strong thrombophilias, do not necessarily develop thrombosis during childhood. Before evaluat- ing for these disorders, both the limitations of the testing and potential benefits need to be considered. The factor V Leiden pathogenic variant is the result of a single base pair change at nucleotide 1765 within the factor V gene caus- ing an R506Q amino acid substitution in the encoded protein. This pathogenic variant causes activated factor V to become resistant to inactivation by activated protein C. It is the most common inherited risk factor for thrombosis, although its prevalence varies across eth- nicities. Individuals who are heterozygous have a 5-­7–fold increased relative risk of venous thrombosis, whereas homozygous individuals have an even higher risk. There appears to be a synergistic prothrom- botic risk enhancement with the inherited risk of factor V Leiden and the acquired risk of estrogen-­containing contraceptives. The baseline annual risk of thrombosis for females of reproductive age is approxi- mately 1/10,000 and increases to 1/2,500 for those taking estrogen-­ containing contraceptives. For young females who are heterozygous for the factor V Leiden pathogenic variant and on estrogen-­containing contraceptives, the annual risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) increases to 1 in 200. The prothrombin 20210 gene pathogenic vari- ant is a G-­to-­A transition in the 3’ untranslated region of the gene that results in increased levels of prothrombin. It is a weaker risk factor for venous thrombosis than factor V Leiden. Deficiencies of the natural anticoagulation proteins (protein C, protein S, and antithrombin) are less common than the specific genetic pathogenic variants mentioned previously but are associated with a stronger risk of thrombosis. Although heterozygous deficien- cies do not often present during childhood, homozygous defects may be embryonically lethal or result in significant symptoms in infancy. Neonates with homozygous deficiencies of protein C or protein S may present with purpura fulminans. This rare condition is characterized by rapidly spreading purpuric skin lesions resulting from thromboses of the small dermal vessels, followed by bleeding into the skin. In addi- tion, these infants may also develop cerebral thrombosis, ophthalmic thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and large-­vessel thrombosis. An infant with purpuric skin lesions of unknown cause should receive empiric replacement with fresh-­frozen plasma. Defini- tive diagnosis can be difficult in the sick premature neonate, who may have undetectable levels of these factors but not have a true genetic deficiency. Protein C and antithrombin concentrates are also available and have been demonstrated to be effective. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been associated with venous and arterial thromboses, although the pathogenic mechanisms for thrombosis in homocystinemia are poorly understood. Thrombo- embolic complications are well described in children with homocys- tinuria, a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by deficiency of cystathione β-­synthase that results in plasma levels of homocysteine Chapter 527 Hereditary Predisposition to Thrombosis Benjamin J.

Much more common are mild to moderate elevations of homocysteine, which may be acquired or associated with a polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Although moderate elevations of homocysteine have been asso- ciated with both venous and arterial thrombotic events, testing for polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene is not indicated because these polymorphisms are common and by themselves (without homocys- tinemia) are not associated with thromboembolism. Increased plasma concentrations of FVIII appear to be regulated by both genetic and environmental factors and are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. High FVIII levels are usually polygenic, although rarely specific changes in the FVIII gene have been identified. FVIII is also an acute-­phase reactant and may increase during periods of inflammation. Although interpretation of gene testing is fairly straightforward, sev- eral challenges in interpretation of thrombophilia studies are unique to pediatric patients. Neonates have decreased concentrations of pro- tein C, protein S, and antithrombin that increase rapidly over the first 6 months of life; protein C concentrations remain below adult levels throughout much of childhood. It is important to use pediatric normal ranges when evaluating these values and recognize that often the nor- mal range overlaps with heterozygous defects and that retesting may be required, particularly in young children. Several nongenetic fac- tors may also influence the results of inherited thrombophilia testing, including acute thrombosis, infection, inflammation, hepatic dysfunc- tion, nephrotic syndrome, medication, and vitamin K deficiency. In some patients the hereditary nature may be confirmed by testing the parents. Thrombophilia testing is considered during childhood when a child develops thrombosis or if a child has relatives with thrombosis or thrombophilia. Thrombophilia testing rarely influences the acute man- agement of a child with a thrombotic event. The majority of children who develop thrombosis have multiple, coexistent acquired risk factors (see Table 528.1 in Chapter 528). More than 90% of thromboses in chil- dren are associated with indwelling intravascular catheters; inherited thrombophilias are uncommon in this scenario, and testing is generally not warranted. However, inherited thrombophilia is more common in an otherwise healthy child or adolescent who develops a blood clot or in a child who develops unusual or recurrent thrombosis. Throm- bophilia testing may be useful in these situations because it may help explain why the child developed a blood clot and inform on the dura- tion of therapy. However, current treatment recommendations do not differ based on the presence or absence of an inherited thrombophilia. The identification of an inherited anticoagulant protein defect, such as antithrombin or protein C deficiency, may allow for replacement thera- pies while off anticoagulation, such as in the perioperative setting. The decision to perform thrombophilia testing in an otherwise healthy child with a family history of thrombosis or thrombophilia should be carefully considered, weighing the potential advantages and limitations of such an approach. Given that the absolute risk of throm- bosis in children is extremely low (0.07/100,000), it is unlikely that an inherited thrombophilia will have any impact on clinical decision-­ making for a young child. The risk of thrombosis increases with age, so identification of a thrombophilic defect in an adolescent may guide primary thromboprophylaxis in high-­risk situations (lower-­extremity casting or prolonged immobility), inform the discussion about estrogen-­based contraceptives, and promote lifestyle modification to avoid behavioral risk factors (sedentary lifestyle, dehydration, obesity, and smoking). Limitations of such testing include the cost as well as the potential for causing unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance. In most patients with inherited thrombophilia, the treatment is the same as for patients with no inherited disorders (see Chapter 528). In neonates with purpura fulminans caused by homozygous protein C or S deficiency or in patients with warfarin-­induced skin necrosis, heparin-­induced thrombocytopenias and severe antithrombin defi- ciency often require factor replacement (protein C, S or antithrom- bin concentrates or plasma) in addition to unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin. In less severe antithrombin deficiency, higher than usual doses of heparin may be needed. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

TEs in children are rare. Diagnosis and treatment are often extrapolated from adult data because of a current lack of high-­quality data in the pediatric setting. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although the overall incidence of thrombosis in the general pediatric population is quite low (0.07/100,000), the rate of venous thromboem- bolism (VTE) in hospitalized children is 60/10,000 admissions. Infants <1 year old account for the largest proportion of pediatric VTEs, with a second peak during adolescence. Most children who develop a TE have multiple risk factors that may be acquired, inherited, or anatomic (Table 528.1). The presence of a central venous catheter (CVC) or peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) is the most important risk factor for VTE in pediatric patients, associated with approximately 90% of neonatal VTE and 60% of childhood VTE. PICC lines may be among the highest-­risk CVC subtypes. CVCs are often necessary for the care of premature neonates and children with acute and chronic diseases and are used for intra- venous (IV) hyperalimentation, chemotherapy, dialysis, antibiotics, or supportive therapy. CVCs may damage the endothelial lining and/or cause blood flow disruption, increasing the risk of thrombosis. Many other acquired risk factors are associated with thrombosis, including trauma, surgery, infection, inflammation, chronic medical conditions, and certain medications. Cancer, congenital heart disease, and prema- turity are the most common medical conditions associated with TEs. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is characterized by recurrent fetal loss and/or thrombosis (Table 528.2). Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with venous and, less often, arterial throm- bosis. The autoantibodies in APS include lupus anticoagulant, anticar- diolipin antibodies, and anti-­β2 glycoprotein I. If all three antibodies are positive (triple positive), the risk of thrombosis is increased. The mechanism by which these antibodies cause thrombosis is not well understood. A diagnosis of APS requires the presence of both clini- cal and laboratory abnormalities (see “Laboratory Testing”). The labo- ratory abnormalities must be identified on two separate occasions, at least 12 weeks apart. Because of the high risk of VTE recurrence, patients with APS often require long-­term anticoagulation, at least until the antibodies have resolved; the type of antibodies and the pres- ence of arterial thrombosis may have important implications for the type of anticoagulant therapy chosen. Up to 20% of healthy children may have a transient lupus anticoagulant, often diagnosed because of a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) on routine preoperative testing. In this setting, transient antibodies may be associated with a recent viral infection and are not a risk factor for thrombosis. APS is also noted in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (see Chap- ter 199) and may also be associated with livedo reticularis, neuropsy- chiatric complications, thrombocytopenia, or anemia; these patients are often persistently positive for the antiphospholipid antibody. Cata- strophic antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare and potentially fatal disorder characterized by rapid onset of multiorgan thrombosis and/ or thrombotic microangiopathies (Table 528.3). Anatomic abnormalities that impede blood flow also predispose patients to thrombosis at an earlier age. Atresia of the inferior vena cava has been described in association with acute and chronic lower-­ extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Compression of the left iliac vein by the overlying right iliac artery (May-­Thurner syndrome) should be considered in patients who present spontaneously with left iliofemoral thrombosis, and thoracic outlet obstruction (Paget-­ Schroetter syndrome) frequently presents with effort-­related axillary-­ subclavian vein thrombosis. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis Children with acute DVT often present with extremity pain, swelling, and discoloration (see Table 524.1). A history of a current or recent CVC in that extremity should be very suggestive. Many times, symp- toms of CVC-­associated thrombosis are more subtle and chronic, including repeated CVC occlusion (potentially requiring clearance with tissue plasminogen activator [tPA]) or sepsis, or prominent venous collaterals on the chest, face, and neck. Pulmonary Embolism Signs and symptoms classically include shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and/or, in the case of massive pulmonary embolism (PE), hypotension and right-­ sided heart failure. Based on autopsy studies in pediatric centers, PE is often undiagnosed because young children are unable to describe their symptoms accurately, and their respiratory deterioration may be masked by other conditions (see Chapter 458.1). Cerebral Sinovenous Thrombosis Signs and symptoms of cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) may be subtle and may develop over many hours or days (see Table 524.1). Neonates with CSVT often present with seizures, whereas older chil- dren often complain of headache, vomiting, seizures, visual changes, and/or focal neurologic signs. They may also have papilledema and abducens palsy. Older patients may have a concurrent sinusitis or mas- toiditis that has contributed to the thrombosis. Other risk factors may include trauma, meningitis, or dehydration. Renal Vein Thrombosis Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the most common spontaneous VTE in neonates (see Table 524.1). Affected infants may present with hema- turia, an abdominal mass, and thrombocytopenia. Infants of diabetic mothers are at increased risk for RVT, although the mechanism for the increased risk is unknown. Approximately 25% of cases are bilateral. Portal Vein Thrombosis Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) often occurs during the neonatal period and is often asymptomatic, only manifesting in those patients who develop symptomatic portal hypertension (e.g., gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, splenomegaly) after the initial thrombotic event (see Table 524.1). The most common risk factor associated with PVT is an umbili- cal venous catheter, although sepsis, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, liver trans- plant, splenectomy, and sickle cell disease are also notable risk factors. A known complication of PVT is cavernous transformation, which confers a risk for variceal bleeding. Peripheral Arterial Thrombosis The majority of arterial TEs in children are associated with catheters, often related to umbilical artery lines in neonates or cardiac catheter- ization via the femoral artery (see Table 524.1). Less common etiolo- gies of arterial thrombosis include homocystinuria and APS. Patients with an arterial thrombosis affecting blood flow to an extremity will present with a cold, pale extremity with poor or absent pulses, which can signify a limb-­threatening emergency. Acute Ischemic Stroke Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) typically presents with hemiparesis, slurred speech, altered consciousness, or seizures. This condition may occur secondary to pathology that affects the intracranial arteries (e.g., sickle cell disease, vasculitis, vasculopathy, traumatic arterial dissection, or paradoxical embolism across a patent foramen ovale) or may result from venous thrombi that embolize to the arterial circulation (placental Chapter 528 Thrombotic Disorders in Children Leslie J.

Rapidly Progressive Thrombosis (Thrombotic Storm) Rapid progression or multifocal thrombosis is a rare complication of APS (catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome), or heparin-­induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (see Table 528.3). Multiorgan dys- function develops in the presence of small vessel occlusion and elevated D-­dimer levels, and this may progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Treatment includes aggressive anticoagulation, often with direct thrombin inhibitors or fondaparinux, followed by prolonged warfarin therapy. In rare cases, plasmapheresis and/or immunosup- pression and/or antiinflammatory therapy may be warranted. DIAGNOSIS Compression ultrasound with Doppler flow is the most common imag- ing study for the diagnosis of extremity DVT and chest CT is used most frequently for the diagnosis of PE (Fig. 528.1). Echocardiogram is often used to detect and follow right atrial clots, most often detected in patients with central catheter tips in the right atrium. Other diagnostic imaging options include CT and MR venography, which are noninvasive, although the sensitivity and specificity of these studies is not known. These studies may be particularly helpful in evaluating proximal or abdominal throm- bosis. For the diagnosis of CSVT and AIS, the most sensitive imaging study is brain MRI with venography or diffusion-­weighted imaging.

In adults with suspected DVT, the D-­dimer level has a high negative predictive value, but the predictive value is not as well established for children. The D-­dimer is a fragment produced when fibrin is degraded by plasmin and is a measure of both clot formation and subsequent fibrinolysis. Based on the clinical scenario, other laboratory studies, such as renal and hepatic function, may be indicated. Testing for APS includes evaluation for the lupus anticoagulant as well as anticardiolipin and anti–β2-­glycoprotein antibodies and should be considered in patients with inflammatory disorders, recent trauma, surgery, or infection, and those who present with thrombosis and no other obvious risk factors. There is debate regarding which patients should have testing for inherited risk factors. Thrombophilia testing rarely influences the acute management of a child with a thrombotic event, and natural antico- agulants like protein C and S or antithrombin (AT) may appear to have low levels due to consumption during the acute phase of thrombosis, even if the patient does not have an existing deficiency of these pro- teins (see Chapter 527). Identification of an inherited thrombophilia may influence the duration of treatment, particularly for those with a strong thrombophilia, and may aid in counseling patients about their risk of recurrence. Unprovoked (absence of risk factors) thrombosis and a family history of thrombotic events may be a clue to an inherited thrombophilia, although they may coincide with a known risk factor. The evaluation and interpretation of coagulation studies in pediatric patients may be complicated by the developing hemostatic system and the differences in normal ranges between infants and adults (see Chapter 527). TREATMENT Therapeutic options for children with thrombosis may include observa- tion, anticoagulation, thrombolysis, and surgery. In premature neonates and critically ill children who are at high risk of bleeding, the potential benefits must be weighed against the risks, and close observation with repeat imaging may be an option. The majority of nonneonates with symptomatic thrombosis are treated with anticoagulant therapy. The goal of anticoagulation is to reduce the risk of embolism, halt clot extension, and prevent recurrence (see Chapter 528.1). Systemic or endovascular thrombolysis may be indicated for organ-­ or limb-­threatening throm- bosis. Surgery may be necessary for life-­ or limb-­threatening thrombosis when there is a contraindication to thrombolysis. The optimal treatment for a child with AIS depends on the likely etiology and the size of the infarct and may include either anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin. Children with sickle cell disease who develop stroke are treated acutely with erythrocytapheresis to rapidly lower the percentage of hemoglobin S and may also receive ongoing chronic red blood cell transfusions (or erythrocytapheresis) to reduce recurrence risk. A summary of management recommendations for various types of VTE can be found in (Tables 528.4 and 528.5) COMPLICATIONS Complications of VTE include recurrent thrombosis (local or distant), and development of post-­thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Over time, due to venous hypertension or damaged endovascular valves, patients may develop pain, swelling, edema, discoloration, and ulceration of the affected limb. Several prospective studies in adults have shown PTS to be present in 17–50% of patients with a history of thrombosis. The like- lihood of developing PTS has been shown to increase with age, throm- bus burden, and delay in anticoagulation therapy. 528.1  Anticoagulant and Thrombolytic Therapy Leslie J. Raffini and Brian R. Branchford Initial options for anticoagulation in children have generally included unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), followed by LMWH or warfarin for outpatient management (see Tables 528.4 and 528.5). Clinical trials of several direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these drugs to treat VTE in children, and the landscape of treatment options for children with thrombosis is changing rapidly as these drugs gain regulatory approval. DOACs act by inhibiting factor Xa or thrombin (Table 528.6). The optimal duration of anticoagulation for children with TEs is not well established. American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines recommend that pediatric patients with provoked DVT or PE receive ≤3 months of anticoagulation and those with unprovoked DVT or PE receive 6-­12 months of therapy. Patients with strong inherited throm- bophilia, recurrent thrombosis, and APS (or other nonmitigatable risk factors) may require indefinite anticoagulation. UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN Both UFH and LMWH act by catalyzing the action of AT. UFH con- sists of large molecular weight polysaccharide chains that interact with AT, supporting the inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin, as well as other serine proteases. Heparin Dosing A therapeutic heparin dose achieves a prolongation of the PTT of 1.5-­2.5 the upper limit of normal. A bolus dose of 75-­100 units/kg results in a therapeutic PTT in the majority of children. This bolus should be followed by a continuous infusion. Initial dosing is based on age, with infants having the highest requirements. It is important to continue to monitor the PTT closely. In some situations, such as patients with a lupus anticoagulant, those with elevated factor VIII, or neonates, the PTT may not accurately reflect the degree of anti- coagulation, and heparin can be monitored using a heparin anti-­Xa level of 0.35-­0.7 units/mL. Heparin Complications Maintaining the PTT in the therapeutic range can be difficult in young children. The bioavailability of heparin is difficult to predict and may be influenced by plasma proteins, including AT level. In many patients, this results in multiple dose adjustments requiring close monitoring with frequent venipuncture. UFH also requires continuous IV access, which may be difficult to maintain in young children. The most common adverse effect related to heparin therapy is bleeding. There are case reports of life-­threatening bleeding in chil- dren treated with heparin. The true frequency of bleeding in pediatric patients receiving heparin has not been well established and is reported as 1–24%. If the anticoagulant effect of heparin must be reversed imme- diately, protamine sulfate may be administered to neutralize the heparin. With an elimination half-­life of approximately 30 minutes, the antico- agulant effect of this drug typically wears off in approximately 2-­3 hours after stopping the infusion. UFH is cleared by the liver and kidney. Other adverse effects include osteoporosis (with long-­term use) and heparin-­induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Although rare in pediatric populations, HIT is a prothrombotic, immune-­mediated Fig. 528.1  Chest CT scan from a 15-­yr-­old male with a large pul- monary embolism.

These antibodies result in platelet activation, stimulation of coagulation, thrombocytopenia, and in some cases, life-­ threatening thrombosis. If HIT is strongly suspected, heparin must be discontinued immediately. An alternative parenteral anticoagulant, including the direct thrombin inhibitors argatroban or bivalirudin, may be used in this situation. LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT HEPARIN In contrast to UFH, LMWH contains smaller molecular weight poly- saccharide chains. The interaction of the smaller chains with AT results primarily in the inhibition of factor Xa, with less of an effect on thrombin. The several LMWHs available have variable inhibitory effects on thrombin. For this reason, the PTT is not a reliable measure of the anticoagulant effect of LMWH, and the anti–factor Xa activity is used instead. Because of the ease of dosing and need for less moni- toring, LMWH is the most frequently used anticoagulant in pediatric patients. Although dalteparin was the first (and currently only) LMWH approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in chil- dren (older than 1 month of age), enoxaparin is the LMWH that has been studied and used more often in pediatric patients. Enoxaparin Dosing The recommended standard starting dose of enoxaparin for infants <2 months old is 1.5 mg/kg/dose subcutaneously every 12 hours and for patients >2 months old, 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, although many Table 528.4     Management Considerations for Pediatric Thromboembolic Events VTE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION COMMENTS Symptomatic DVT Anticoagulation Provoked—treat <3 months (or until provoking factor is resolved) Unprovoked—treat 6-­12 months, or longer based on risk/benefit analysis Thrombolysis considered if life-­ or limb-­threatening VTE IVC filter considered if absolute contraindication to anticoagulation Observation may be necessary or reasonable for premature neonates or critically ill children at high risk of bleeding Recommendations vary regarding utility of radiographic follow-­up Asymptomatic DVT Anticoagulation or observation Natural history is unclear, decision may vary based on VTE-­ and patient-­specific factors Massive PE (hemodynamic compromise) Thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation Submassive PE (no hemodynamic compromise) Anticoagulation alone CVC-­related Anticoagulation Removal of CVC if not functioning or no longer needed Duration of anticoagulation needed before CVC removal is still being investigated, and recommendations vary Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) Unilateral: Anticoagulation alone Bilateral: Consider thrombolysis for bilateral RVT (life-­ or organ-­threatening) Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) Occlusive: Anticoagulation Nonocclusive: Observation (close radiologic follow-­up) Observe for cavernous transformation.

In general, peak levels are achieved 3-­6 hours after injection. A therapeutic anti– factor Xa level, drawn 4 hours after the second or third dose, should be 0.5-­1.0 IU/mL; the dose can be titrated to achieve this range. The elimination half-­life of enoxaparin is 4-­6 hours. Enoxaparin is cleared by the kidney and should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. It should be avoided in patients with renal failure. After an initial period of anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH, patients may continue to receive LMWH as an outpatient for the dura- tion of therapy or may be transitioned to an oral anticoagulant such as warfarin. Direct Thrombin Inhibitors Argatroban and bivalirudin are IV direct thrombin inhibitors that are used in the setting of HIT, complex heart disease/failure cases with ventricular assist devices, or other relatively uncommon situations in pediatrics. They have short half-­lives but cannot be fully reversed. Dos- ing has not been well established in children. WARFARIN Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that competitively interferes with vitamin K metabolism, exerting its action by decreasing concentra- tions of the vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as protein C and protein S. Therapy should be started while a patient is anticoagulated with heparin or LMWH because of the risk of warfarin-­induced skin necrosis. This transient hypercoagulable condi- tion may occur when levels of protein C drop more rapidly than the procoagulant factors. Dosing Warfarin therapy is often initiated with a weight-­based loading dose, with subsequent dose adjustments made according to a nomogram. When initiating warfarin therapy, UFH or LMWH should be contin- ued until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic for 2 days. In most patients, this takes 5-­7 days. The PT is used to moni- tor the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Because the thromboplastin reagents used in PT assays have widely varying sensitivities, the PT performed in one laboratory cannot be compared with that performed in another laboratory. As a result, the INR was developed as a mecha- nism to standardize the variation in the thromboplastin reagent. The target INR range depends on the clinical situation. In general, a range of 2.0-­3.0 is the target for the treatment of VTE. High-­risk patients, such as those with mechanical heart valves, APS, or recurrent throm- bosis, may require a higher target range. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 affect the pharmacokinet- ics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Pharmacogenetic testing can identify wild-­type responders, as well as those who are more sensitive (increased risk of bleeding). Genotyping in adults may help select war- farin dose, monitor for bleeding, or choose a DOAC instead of warfa- rin for patients highly sensitive and at risk for hemorrhage. Complications Bleeding is the most common adverse effect of warfarin. The risk of serious bleeding in children receiving warfarin for the treatment of VTE has been reported at 0.5% per year. Children who have supra- therapeutic INR are at higher risk. There is considerable interpatient variation in dose. Diet, medications, and illness may influence the metabolism of warfarin, requiring frequent dose adjustments and labo- ratory studies. Numerous medications can affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin by altering its clearance or rate of absorption. These effects can have a profound impact on the INR and must be considered when monitoring a patient receiving warfarin. The strategies used to reverse warfarin therapy depend on the clini- cal situation and whether there is bleeding. Vitamin K can be admin- istered to reverse the effect of warfarin but takes some time to have an effect. If the patient is having significant bleeding, a nonactivated plasma-­derived 4-­factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or fresh-­frozen plasma (FFP, 15 mL/kg) should be given along with the vitamin K. PCCs have not been well investigated in children. Nonhemorrhagic complications are uncommon in children, although hair loss has been reported. Warfarin is a teratogen, particu- larly in the first trimester. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by bone and cartilage abnormalities known as chondrodysplasia punctata. Affected infants may have nasal hypoplasia and excessive calcifications in the epiphyses and vertebrae. DIRECT ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS Oral direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) or inhibitors of factor Xa (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) are approved for the prevention or treatment of thrombosis in patients >18 years old (see Table 528.6), and dabigatran is FDA-­approved for children older than 3 months of age.

Chapter 528  u  Thrombotic Disorders in Children  3045 K, and no need to monitor laboratory tests, as well as initial results sug- gesting noninferiority to warfarin and fewer bleeding episodes, have favored the use of DOACs. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in children. Drugs are avail- able to reverse the effects of DOACs if indicated. DOACs should be avoided in patients with APS in the presence of arterial thrombosis. THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY Although anticoagulation alone is often effective at managing throm- bosis while awaiting natural fibrinolysis, more rapid clot resolution may sometimes be necessary or desirable. In these situations, a throm- bolytic agent that can activate the fibrinolytic system is of potential benefit. The pharmacologic activity of thrombolytic agents depends on the conversion of endogenous plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is then able to degrade several plasma proteins, including fibrin and fibrino- gen. Because of the high risk of bleeding, thrombolytic therapy is gen- erally reserved for patients with life-­ or limb-­threatening thrombosis. tPA is available as a recombinant product and has become the pri- mary agent used for thrombolysis in children, although proper dose finding studies have not been performed. Depending on the situation, tPA may be used systemically or locally with catheter-­directed throm- bolysis, sometimes with the addition of mechanical clot lysis devices operated by interventional radiologists. Dosing An extremely wide range of doses of tPA has been used for systemic therapy, and no consensus exists as to the optimal dose. Systemic tPA doses of 0.1-­0.6 mg/kg/hr were previously recommended, although recent reports indicate successful therapy with fewer bleeding compli- cations using prolonged infusions with very low doses—0.01-­0.06 mg/ kg/hr. Monitoring There is no specific laboratory test to document a “therapeutic range” for thrombolytic therapy. It is important to maintain the fibrinogen >100 mg/dL and the platelet count >75,000 × 109/L during treatment. Supplementation of plasminogen using FFP is generally recommended in neonates before initiating thrombolysis because of their low baseline levels. The clinical and radiologic response to thrombolysis should be closely monitored. The duration of therapy depends on the clinical response. Invasive procedures, including urinary catheterization, arte- rial puncture, and rectal temperatures, should be avoided. The role of adjuvant UFH during thrombolytic therapy is controver- sial. Animal models have demonstrated that thrombolytic therapy can induce a procoagulant state with activation of the coagulation system, generation of thrombin, and extension or reocclusion of the thrombo- sis. In pediatric patients thought to be at low risk for bleeding, adjuvant UFH should be considered using doses of 10-­20 units/kg/hr. The rec- ommended duration of therapy is noted in Table 528.7. Complications The most serious complication from thrombolysis is bleeding, which has been reported in 0–40% of patients. Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis include major surgery within 7 days, history of signifi- cant bleeding (intracranial, pulmonary, or GI), peripartum asphyxia with brain damage, uncontrolled hypertension, and severe thrombo- cytopenia. In the event of serious bleeding, thrombolysis should be stopped, and cryoprecipitate should be given to replace fibrinogen. THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS There have been no formal trials of VTE prevention in children, although many institutions are starting to develop and use risk-­guided algorithms to identify children who may benefit from mechanical (sequential compression devices) or pharmacologic (low-­dose antico- agulant) prevention strategies in the absence of concomitant bleeding risk. Hospitalized adolescents with multiple risk factors for thrombosis who are immobilized for a prolonged period are a group that expert consensus would suggest may benefit from prophylactic treatment with enoxaparin, 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours (maximum 30 mg). ANTIPLATELET THERAPY Inhibition of platelet function using agents such as aspirin is more likely to be protective against arterial TEs than VTEs. Aspirin, or acetylsali- cylic acid (ASA), exerts its antiplatelet effect by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase, preventing platelet thromboxane A2 production. Aspi- rin is used routinely in children with Kawasaki disease and may also be useful in children with stroke, ventricular assist devices, and single-­ ventricle cardiac defects. The recommended dose of aspirin to achieve an antiplatelet effect in children is 1-­5 mg/kg/day. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

The biologic activity of the “vitamin K–dependent factors” (coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S) requires vitamin K for their posttranslational carboxylation. In the absence of vita- min K, only nonfunctional forms of these proteins are synthesized, which are ineffective for hemostasis. Severe vitamin K deficiency will result in a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), although early deficiency may only demonstrate a prolonged PT because of the short half-­life of factor VII. Plasma levels of uncarboxylated factor II are measured in the PIVKA-­II (proteins induced by vitamin K absence) test and elevated levels are diagnostic of vitamin K deficiency, although clinical history and basic coagulation labs are usually sufficient to make the diag- nosis. It can often be clinically helpful to distinguish between deficiencies of the vitamin K–dependent factors and deficiencies in the clotting factors synthesized by hepatocytes due to liver disease (see Chapter 530), which includes the vitamin K–dependent factors as well as factors V and XI. Intestinal malabsorption of fats may accompany cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia, or other liver diseases and results in a deficiency of fat-­ soluble dietary vitamins including vitamin K. Prophylactic administration of water-­soluble vitamin K orally is indi- cated in these patients (2-­5 mg/24 hr for children and 5-­10 mg/24 hr for adolescents and adults). Vitamin K may also be administered at 1-­2 mg intravenously. Broad-­spectrum antibiotics can alter the intestinal flora, reducing the vitamin K that is produced in the gastrointestinal tract. Patients have only a few weeks of vitamin K stores. The anticoagulant prop- erties of warfarin (Coumadin) depend on interference with vitamin K, with a concomitant reduction of the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. Rat poison (superwarfarin) produces a similar deficiency that should be considered in young children presenting with bleeding and bruising with a history compatible with ingestion. There are also cases of illicit drugs being adulterated with vitamin K antagonists. Vitamin K is a specific antidote for these substances. Four factor prothrombin complex concentrates contain all the vitamin K–­dependent clotting factors; they are available for warfa- rin reversal and have been used to rapidly replace vitamin K–dependent clotting factors in urgent scenarios. Dosing is based on the international normalized ratio (INR), and vitamin K should also be administered. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. Chapter 529 Postneonatal Vitamin K Deficiency Brian R. Branchford, Benjamin J. Samelson-­ Jones, and Veronica H. Flood Because all the clotting factors except factor VIII (which is synthe- sized in liver sinusoids and extrahepatic endothelium) are produced Chapter 530 Coagulopathy in Liver Disease Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood exclusively in hepatocytes, coagulation abnormalities are very com- mon in patients with severe liver disease (Table 530.1). Only 15% of such patients have significant clinical bleeding states, possibly because of concomitant reduction in anticoagulation proteins (pro- tein C and S). The severity of the coagulation abnormality appears to be directly proportional to the extent of hepatocellular damage. The most common mechanism causing the hemostasis defect is decreased synthesis of coagulation factors. Patients with severe liver disease characteristically have normal to increased (not reduced) levels of factor VIII activity in plasma. In some instances, dissemi- nated intravascular coagulation (DIC; see Chapter 510), hypofi- brinogenemia, or hyperfibrinolysis may complicate liver disease, making laboratory differentiation of severe liver disease from DIC-­ related clotting factor consumption difficult. These entities, as well as vitamin K deficiency (see Chapter 529), may be distinguished by comparing levels of a hepatically synthesized factor (such as factor V), a hepatically synthesized vitamin K–dependent factor (such as factor VII), and a nonhepatically synthesized factor that could be subject to consumption (such as factor VIII). Treatment of the coagulopathy of liver disease should be reserved for patients with clinical bleeding rather than used to normalize the lab values. Because a reduction in vitamin K–dependent coagula- tion factors is common in those with acute or chronic liver disease, a trial of vitamin K supplementation can be given. Vitamin K can be given orally, subcutaneously, or preferably intravenously (not intra- muscularly) at a dose of 1 mg/24 hr for infants, 2-­5 mg/24 hr for children, and 5-­10 mg/24 hr for adolescents and adults. Inability to correct coagulopathy with vitamin K indicates that the coagulopa- thy may be caused by reduced levels of clotting factors that are not vitamin K–dependent and/or by inadequate production of precur- sor vitamin K proteins. Treatment for bleeding consists of factor replacement with fresh-­frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate. FFP (10-­15 mL/kg) contains all clotting factors, but replacement of fibrinogen for severe hypofibrinogenemia may require cryopre- cipitate at a dose of 1 unit per 5-­10 kg body weight, or a fibrinogen concentrate if a patient is unable to tolerate excess fluid volume. In severe liver disease, it is often difficult to attain correction of abnormal clotting studies despite vigorous therapy with FFP and cryoprecipitate, and such attempts are often complicated by volume overload concerns. Some patients with bleeding as a result of liver disease have responded to therapy with desmopressin (DDAVP), whereas others have responded to treatment with recombinant fac- tor VIIa, albeit at a dose lower than typically given for hemophilia. Recombinant factor VIIa is contraindicated in DIC. Desmopressin (0.3 μg/kg intravenously) is effective in short- ening bleeding time, prompts endothelial cell release of von Wil- lebrand factor and factor VIII, promotes platelet activation, and is therefore used effectively to augment hemostasis before diagnostic liver biopsy in the setting of hepatic insufficiency/failure. In clinical trials of adults, recombinant factor VIIa has not been shown to be effective for the treatment of bleeding caused by severe liver dis- ease, possibly because of its short half-­life (3-­6 hours). Frequently, severe liver disease is associated with moderate prolongation of coagulation disorder screening tests (partial thromboplastin time [PTT]; prothrombin time [PT]) that is not corrected by vitamin K or plasma replacement. Another diagnostic clue may be a low serum albumin level because this protein is also synthesized in the liver. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Acquired circulating anticoagulants (inhibitors) are antibodies that react, or cross-­react, with clotting factors or components used in coag- ulation screening tests (phospholipids), thereby prolonging screening tests, such as prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), although not all of them result in a clinical bleeding state. Some of these anticoagulants are autoantibodies that react with phospholipid and thereby interfere with clotting in vitro but not in vivo. This group comprises anticardiolipin and anti-­beta(2)-­glycoprotein-­Ib antibodies, but the most common subtype of these antiphospholipid antibodies has been referred to as the lupus anticoagulant (see Chapter 528.1). This unfortunately named antibody is neither found exclusively in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; see Chapter 199), nor does its presence consistently signify the concomitant presence of SLE in a patient. It can also be seen in those with other collagen vascu- lar diseases and in association with HIV infection. In otherwise healthy children, spontaneous lupus-­like inhibitors have developed transiently after incidental viral infection and can be seen in up to 26% of screen- ing tests in asymptomatic subjects. These transient inhibitors are usu- ally not associated with either bleeding or thrombosis. Although the classic lupus anticoagulant is more often associated with a predisposition to thrombosis than with bleeding symptoms, bleeding symptoms in a patient with the lupus anticoagulant may be caused by thrombocytopenia, which may be a manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome or of lupus itself (alone or occasionally in context with Evans syndrome), or, rarely, by a coexistent specific auto- antibody against prothrombin (factor II). The antiprothrombin anti- body does not inactivate prothrombin but rather causes accelerated clearance of the protein, resulting in low levels of prothrombin and subsequent inadequate hemostasis. Rarely, antibodies may arise spontaneously against a specific clot- ting factor, such as factor VIII or von Willebrand factor, leading to acquired hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease (VWD), but this is usually seen more frequently in adult patients. These patients are prone to excessive hemorrhage and may require specific treatment. In patients with a hereditary deficiency of a clotting factor (factor VIII or factor IX), antibodies may develop after exposure to transfused factor concentrates. These hemophilic inhibitory antibodies are discussed in Chapter 525.1. LABORATORY FINDINGS Inhibitors against specific coagulation factors usually affect factors VIII, IX, and XI, or, rarely, prothrombin (factor II). Depending on the target of the antibody and the target’s participation in the intrinsic, extrinsic, Chapter 531 Acquired Inhibitors of Coagulation Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood or common coagulation cascade pathway, the PT and/or PTT may be prolonged. The mechanism by which the inhibitory antibody functions determines whether mixing patient plasma with normal plasma will normalize (correct) the clotting time. Patient plasma that contains anti- bodies directed against the active site of a clotting factor (factor VIII or factor IX) will not correct on 1:1 mixing with normal plasma, whereas antibodies that lead to increased clearance of the factor (such as anti- prothrombin antibodies) will correct on such mixing studies. Specific factor assays are used to determine which factor is involved, and the pattern of abnormalities in PT, PTT, and/or thrombin time (TT) is used to guide initial investigation. TREATMENT Management of the bleeding patient with an acquired inhibitory autoantibody against factor VIII or IX is the same as for the patient with congenital hemophilia who has an alloantibody against factor VIII or factor IX. Infusions of recombinant factor VIIa or activated prothrombin complex concentrate may be needed to control signifi- cant bleeding. Occasionally, high-­dose coagulation factor VIII or IX concentrates may be effective. Immunosuppressive agents have been used “off label” to treat the inhibitor or reduce titers. Acute bleeding caused by an antiprothrombin antibody can often be treated with a plasma infusion and may resolve with a short course of corticosteroid therapy. Asymptomatic spontaneous inhibitors that arise after a viral infec- tion tend to disappear within a few weeks to months. Inhibitors seen with an underlying disease, such as those associated with SLE, often resolve during the treatment of the underlying disease.

Raffini Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired clinico- pathologic syndrome characterized by the widespread pathologic acti- vation of the coagulation system, which results in both microvascular thrombi and the consumption of clotting factors, anticoagulant pro- teins, and platelets. Microvasculature injury can contribute to organ dysfunction, while hemorrhage can be life-­threatening in a minority of cases. The diagnosis of DIC is based on the laboratory findings and clinical manifestations within the appropriate clinical context.

All rights reserved. 3048  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood simultaneous occurrence of bleeding and clotting is clinically challeng- ing, with management starting from appropriately recognizing this syndrome. ETIOLOGY DIC is always a secondary complication of an underlying disor- der (Table 532.1) and never an isolated diagnosis. The complex pathogenesis involves the loss of localization and excessive activa- tion of coagulation leading to unregulated thrombin generation and microvascular fibrin deposition. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium can both precipitate and amplify this process. The excessive activation consumes platelets, procoagulant clotting fac- tors (factor V, factor VIII, prothrombin, and fibrinogen), and anti- coagulant proteins (protein C, protein S, and antithrombin). The fibrinolytic system can also become dysregulated with endothelial injury and plasma protein consumption. LABORATORY FINDINGS Although DIC is characterized by a number of abnormal labora- tory findings, none are specific for the diagnosis. The consump- tion of coagulation factors and platelets often results in a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), an increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and low platelet counts. Low fibrinogen is seen in severe dis- ease, but as an acute-­phase reactant, fibrinogen may be high or nor- mal early in the disease process; declining fibrinogen levels, even within the normal range, can suggest DIC. Fibrinogen degradation products and D-­dimer levels are frequently highly elevated. Fac- tors V and VIII are usually both reduced in DIC, whereas in acute hepatic disease, factor VIII may be normal or elevated. Thrombi in the microvasculature can lead to red blood cell fragmentation and a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with elevated lactate dehy- drogenase and characteristic blood smear morphology, including schistocytes, helmet cells, and microspherocytes. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS DIC may be subclinical with only laboratory abnormalities, termed nonovert DIC. Clinical manifestations include thrombotic and hem- orrhagic complications, as well as organ dysfunction. Bleeding fre- quently first occurs from sites of venipuncture or surgical incision, and the skin may show petechiae, purpura, and ecchymoses. Local- ized large-­vessel arterial or venous thromboembolic events can occur. Tissue necrosis may involve many organs and can be most spectacularly seen as infarction of large areas of skin and subcuta- neous tissue. A compromised blood supply can lead to organ dys- function including organ failure, especially to the lungs, kidneys, liver, and brain. MANAGEMENT The primary treatment of DIC is resolving the underlying triggering disease process. Blood components support is recommended for active hemorrhage or in patients requiring invasive procedures; this may consist of platelet infusions (for thrombocytopenia), cryo- precipitate (for hypofibrinogenemia), and fresh-­frozen plasma (for replacement of other coagulation factors and anticoagulant pro- teins). Blood product support in the absence of bleeding should not be based solely on laboratory abnormalities, but clinical practice varies on the importance of minor bleeding symptoms. Hemostatic products with activated clotting factors such as recombinant fac- tor VIIa (FVIIa) and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) theoretically may worsen the widespread and unregulated generation of thrombin. Likewise, systemic antifibrinolytics are generally contraindicated except in clinical scenarios associated with hyperfibrinolysis such as acute promyelocytic leukemia and early trauma. DIC patients with overt thromboembolic complications should receive therapeutic anticoagulation, usually with unfractionated heparin, as outlined in Chapter 528.1; stringent attention to replace- ment therapy is warranted to maintain an adequate platelet count to limit bleeding. Prophylactic anticoagulation may be carefully used in patients with DIC at high risk of thromboembolic events that are not actively bleeding. Most patients should receive mechanical thromboprophylaxis such as sequential compression devices. The prognosis of patients with DIC is primarily dependent on the outcome of the treatment of the primary disease and prevention of end-­organ damage.

Chapter 533  u  Platelet and Blood Vessel Disorders  3049 MEGAKARYOPOIESIS Platelets are anuclear cellular fragments produced by megakaryocytes (large polyploid cells) within the bone marrow, lung, and other tis- sues. When the megakaryocyte approaches maturity, budding of the cytoplasm occurs, and large numbers of platelets are liberated. Platelets circulate with a life span of 7-­10 days. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary growth factor that controls platelet production (Fig. 533.1). Levels of TPO appear to correlate inversely with platelet number and megakaryocyte mass, with highest expression in the thrombocytopenic states associated with decreased marrow megakaryopoiesis, and may be variable in states of increased platelet production. The platelet plays multiple hemostatic roles. The platelet surface pos- sesses a number of important receptors for adhesive proteins, including von Willebrand factor (VWF) and fibrinogen, as well as receptors for agonists that trigger platelet aggregation, such as thrombin, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). After injury to the blood vessel wall, the extracellular matrix containing adhesive and procoagulant proteins is exposed. Subendothelial collagen binds VWF, which then undergoes a conformational change that induces binding of the platelet glyco- protein Ib (GPIb) complex, the VWF receptor. This process is called platelet adhesion. Platelets then undergo activation. During the process of activation, the platelets generate thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid via the enzyme cyclooxygenase. After activation, platelets release agonists, such as ADP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), calcium ions (Ca2+), serotonin, and coagulation factors, into the surrounding milieu from dense and alpha granules. Binding of VWF to the GPIb complex triggers a complex signaling cascade that results in activation of the fibrinogen receptor, the major platelet integrin glycoprotein αIIb-­β3 (GPIIb-­IIIa). Circulating fibrinogen binds to this receptor on activated platelets, linking platelets in a process called aggregation. This series of events forms a hemostatic plug at the site of vascular injury. The serotonin and histamine that are liberated during activation increase local vasoconstriction. In addition to acting in concert with the vessel wall to form the platelet plug, the platelet provides the catalytic phos- pholipid surface on which coagulation factors assemble and eventually generate thrombin through a sequential series of enzymatic cleavages. Lastly, the platelet contractile proteins and cytoskeleton mediate clot retraction. THROMBOCYTOPENIA The normal platelet count is 150-­450 × 109/L. Thrombocytopenia refers to a reduction in platelet count to <150 × 109/L, although clinically significant bleeding is not seen until counts drop well below 50 × 109/L. Causes of thrombocytopenia include decreased production on either a congenital or an acquired basis, sequestration of the platelets within an enlarged spleen or other organ, and increased destruction of nor- mally synthesized platelets on either an immune or a nonimmune basis (Tables 533.1-­533.3, Fig. 533.2, and Chapter 524). 533.1  Immune Thrombocytopenia Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood The most common cause of acute onset of thrombocytopenia in an otherwise-­well child is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) (also called immune or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). EPIDEMIOLOGY In a small number of children, estimated at 1/20,000, 1-­4 weeks after exposure to a common viral infection, an autoantibody directed against the platelet surface develops with resultant sudden onset of thrombocy- topenia. A recent history of viral illness is described in 50–65% of chil- dren with ITP. The peak age is 1-­4 years, although the age ranges from early in infancy to elderly. In childhood, males and females are equally affected. ITP seems to occur more often in late winter and spring after the peak season of viral respiratory illness. Approximately 5–10% of ITP may recur more than 3 months after initial disease resolution. PATHOGENESIS The exact antigenic target for most such antibodies in most cases of childhood acute ITP remains undetermined, although in chronic ITP, many patients demonstrate antibodies against αIIb-­β3 and GPIb. After binding of the antibody to the platelet surface, circulating antibody-­ coated platelets are recognized by the Fc receptor on splenic macro- phages, ingested, and destroyed. The most common identifiable viruses that have been described in association with ITP include Epstein-­Barr Chapter 533 Platelet and Blood Vessel Disorders Brian R. Branchford, Benjamin J. Samelson-­ Jones, and Veronica H. Flood Fig. 533.1  Scheme of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production in immune thrombocy- topenia (ITP). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are mobilized, and megakaryocyte (MK) and erythroid progenitors (MEP) accumulate with MK-­committed progenitors (MKP), giving rise to mature MKs un- der control of thrombopoietin (TPO) working with chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors, includ- ing stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin (IL)-­3, IL-­6, and IL-­11. Endoreplication results in ploidy changes in MKs and increased chromosome number (up to 64N). Mature MKs migrate to the endothelial cell barrier delimiting the vascular sinus and, under the influence of stromal-­derived factor-­1 (SDF-­1), give rise to proplatelets that protrude into the circula- tion and produce large numbers of platelets under hemodynamic determinants. Therapeutically given romiplostim and eltrombopag enter the marrow and join with TPO to stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. (From Nurden AT, Viallard JF, Nurden P.

EBV-­related ITP is usually of short duration and follows the course of infectious mononucleosis. HIV-­associated ITP is usu- ally chronic. In some patients, ITP appears to arise in children infected with Helicobacter pylori or rarely after vaccines. The SARS-­CoV-­2 virus responsible for the COVID-­19 infection has been associated with development of ITP, as have some of the vaccines for this virus. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS The classic presentation of ITP is a previously healthy 1–4-­year-­old child who has sudden onset of generalized petechiae and purpura. The parents often state that the child was fine the previous day but is now covered with bruises and purple dots. There may be bleeding from the gums and mucous membranes, particularly with profound thrombocy- topenia (platelet count <10 × 109/L). There is a history of a preced- ing viral infection 1-­4 weeks before the onset of thrombocytopenia. Findings on physical examination are typically normal, other than petechiae and purpura. Splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, bone pain, and pallor are rare. A simple classification system to characterize the severity of bleeding in ITP on the basis of symptoms and signs rather than platelet count includes: 1.	No symptoms 2.	Mild symptoms: Bruising and petechiae, occasional minor epistaxis, very little interference with daily living 3.	Moderate symptoms: More severe skin and mucosal lesions, more troublesome epistaxis, and menorrhagia 4.	Severe symptoms: Bleeding episodes—menorrhagia, epistaxis, me- lena—requiring transfusion or hospitalization, symptoms interfer- ing seriously with the quality of life The presence of abnormal findings such as hepatosplenomegaly, bone or joint pain, remarkable lymphadenopathy, other cytopenias, or congenital anomalies suggests other diagnoses (e.g., leukemia, genetic syndromes). When the onset is insidious, especially in an adolescent, chronic ITP or the possibility of a systemic illness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is more likely. In addition, presentation at an atypical age (neonates, adolescents) should suggest an underlying disease. OUTCOME Severe bleeding is rare (<3% of cases in one large international study). In 70–80% of children who present with acute ITP, spontaneous reso- lution occurs within 6 months. Therapy does not appear to affect the natural history of the illness. Fewer than 1% of patients develop an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Proponents of interventional therapy argue that the objective of early therapy is to raise the platelet count to >20 × 109/L and prevent the rare development of ICH. There is no evidence that therapy prevents serious bleeding. Approximately 20% of children who present with acute ITP go on to have chronic ITP. The outcome/prognosis may be related more to age; ITP in younger chil- dren is more likely to resolve, whereas development of chronic ITP in adolescents approaches 50%. LABORATORY FINDINGS Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 × 109/L) is common, and platelet size is normal or increased, reflective of increased platelet turn- over (Fig. 533.3). In acute ITP, the hemoglobin value, white blood cell (WBC) count, and differential count are usually normal. Hemoglobin may be decreased in the context of profuse nosebleeds (epistaxis) or menorrhagia. Bone marrow examination, which is not routinely indi- cated in this disease, shows normal granulocytic and erythrocytic series, with characteristically normal or increased numbers of mega- karyocytes. Some of the megakaryocytes may appear to be immature and reflect increased platelet turnover. Indications for bone marrow aspiration/biopsy include an abnormal WBC count or differential or unexplained anemia, as well as history and physical examination find- ings suggestive of a bone marrow failure syndrome or malignancy. Other laboratory tests should be performed as indicated by the history and examination. HIV studies should be done in at-­risk populations, especially sexually active teens. Platelet antibody testing is seldom use- ful in acute ITP. A direct antiglobulin test (Coombs) should be done if there is unexplained anemia to rule out Evans syndrome (autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia; see Chapter 506). Evans syndrome may be idiopathic or an early sign of SLE, autoimmune lym- phoproliferative syndrome, or common variable immunodeficiency Table 533.1     Differential Diagnosis of Thrombocytopenia in Children and Adolescents DESTRUCTIVE THROMBOCYTOPENIAS Primary Platelet Consumption Syndromes Immune thrombocytopenias Acute and chronic ITP Autoimmune diseases with chronic ITP as a manifestation • Cyclic thrombocytopenia • Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and its variants • Systemic lupus erythematosus • Evans syndrome • Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome • Neoplasia-­associated immune thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia associated with HIV Neonatal immune thrombocytopenia • Alloimmune • Autoimmune (e.g., maternal ITP) Drug-­induced immune thrombocytopenia (including heparin-­ induced thrombocytopenia) Posttransfusion purpura Allergy and anaphylaxis Posttransplant thrombocytopenia Nonimmune thrombocytopenias Thrombocytopenia of infection • Bacteremia or fungemia • Viral infection • Protozoan Thrombotic microangiopathic disorders • Hemolytic-­uremic syndrome • Eclampsia, HELLP syndrome • Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura • Bone marrow transplantation–associated microangiopathy • Drug induced (quinine, etc.) Platelets in contact with foreign material Congenital heart disease Drug-­induced via direct platelet effects (ristocetin, protamine) Type 2B VWD or platelet-­type VWD Combined Platelet and Fibrinogen Consumption Syndromes Disseminated intravascular coagulation Kasabach-­Merritt syndrome Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (inherited or acquired) IMPAIRED PLATELET PRODUCTION Hereditary disorders (see Table 533.2) Acquired disorders • Aplastic anemia • Myelodysplastic syndrome • Marrow infiltrative process—neoplasia • Osteopetrosis • Nutritional deficiency states (iron, folate, vitamin B12, anorexia nervosa) • Drug-­ or radiation-­induced thrombocytopenia • Neonatal hypoxia or placental insufficiency SEQUESTRATION Hypersplenism Hypothermia Burns ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER DISEASES Fanconi anemia Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia Shwachman-­Diamond syndrome Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis TAFRO syndrome HELLP, Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets; HIV, human immunode- ficiency virus; ITP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura; TAFRO, thrombocytopenia, ascites, myelofibrosis renal dysfunction, organomegaly (a variant of multicentric Castleman disease); VWD, von Willebrand disease.

An antinuclear antibody should be considered in adoles- cents, especially with other features of SLE (see Chapter 199). DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The well-­appearing child with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia, an otherwise normal complete blood cell count (CBC), and normal exam findings has a limited differential diagnosis that includes exposure to medication inducing drug-­dependent antibodies, splenic sequestration because of previously unappreciated portal hypertension, and, rarely, early aplastic processes, such as Fanconi anemia (see Chapter 517). Other than congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes (see Chapter 533.8), such as thrombocytopenia–absent radius (TAR) syndrome and MYH9-­related thrombocytopenia, most marrow processes that interfere with platelet production eventually cause abnormal synthesis of red blood cells (RBCs) and WBCs and therefore manifest diverse abnormalities on the CBC. Dis- orders that cause increased platelet destruction on a nonimmune basis are usually serious systemic illnesses with obvious clinical findings such as hemolytic-­uremic syndrome (HUS) and disseminated intravascular Table 533.2     Inherited Platelet Disorders—cont’d PLATELET DEFECT GENE DEFECT (CHROMOSOMAL LOCATION) CLINICAL AND LABORATORY CHARACTERISTICS BLEEDING TREATMENT Quebec platelet disorder (QPD) Autosomal recessive Tandem duplication of PLAU (10q22.2) • Delayed-­onset bleeding not responding to platelet transfusion • Variable thrombocytopenia • Abnormal urokinase in platelets detected with immunoblot or ELISA • PLAU duplication testing • Supportive care • Antifibrinolytics Paris-­Trousseau/Jacobsen syndrome (PTS) Autosomal dominant Deletion of chromosome 11q23–24 Hemizygous deletion of FLI1 (11q24.1 – q24.3) • Thrombocytopenia • Large platelets • Giant α-­granules on TEM • Immature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow • Cognitive, cardiac, and facial abnormalities • Supportive care • Antifibrinolytics • Platelet transfusion PLATELET GRANULES DEFECTS (δ-­GRANULES) Hermansky-­Pudlak syndrome (HPS) Autosomal recessive HPS1–10 (HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, DTNBP1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S6, and AP3D1) • Decreased to absent δ-­granules • Lumiaggregometry: decreased/ absent ATP release • Whole-­mount EM • Gene sequencing of 10 candidate genes • Oculocutaneous albinism • Supportive care • Antifibrinolytics • Platelet transfusion • DDAVP Chediak-­Higashi syndrome (CHS) Autosomal recessive LYST (1q42 – 1q42.2) • Giant eosinophilic inclusions in neutrophils • Decreased to absent δ-­granules • Lumiaggregometry: decreased/ absent ATP release • Hypopigmentation and immuno- deficiency • Supportive care PLATELET CYTOSKELETAL DEFECTS Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome (WAS) / X-­linked thrombocytopenia X-­linked WAS (Xp11.23 – p11.22) encoding WAS protein • Thrombocytopenia • Small platelets • Recurrent infections and eczema • Decreased/absent intracellular • WASp per immunoblot/ELISA • WAS gene sequencing • Supportive care • Platelet transfusion • Antifibrinolytics • Splenectomy (not recommended) ARPC1B deficiency Autosomal recessive ARPC1B (7q22.1) • Small platelets • Inflammatory disease, recurrent infections, small vessel vasculitis, abnormal platelet function • Decreased/absent intracellular • ARPC1B per immunoblot • ARPC1B gene sequencing • Supportive care • Antifibrinolytics • Platelet transfusion MYH9-­related disease (MYH9-­RD) Autosomal dominant MYH9 (22q12–13) encoding nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA • Thrombocytopenia • Large platelets • Döhle-­like inclusions in neutrophils • Myosin IIA aggregates in neutrophils -­ immunofluorescence microscopy • Variable degree of renal disease, sensorineural hearing loss, presenile cataract • Supportive care • Platelet transfusion • Antifibrinolytics • THPO receptor agonists VWF, Von Willebrand factor; HPA, human platelet antigen; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; EM, electron microscopy; ELISA, enzyme-­linked im- munosorbent assay; DDAVP, desmopressin; THPO, thrombopoietin.

Patients receiving heparin may develop heparin-­induced thrombocytope- nia. Isolated enlargement of the spleen suggests the potential for hyper- splenism caused by liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia may be an initial manifestation of SLE, HIV infection, common variable immunodeficiency, and, rarely, lymphoma or autoim- mune lymphoproliferative syndrome. Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome (WAS) must be considered in young males found to have thrombocytopenia with small platelets, particularly if there is a history of eczema and recurrent infection (see Chapter 165.2). Bernard-­Soulier syndrome, on the other hand, involves a macrothrombocytopenia. Gray platelet syndrome is usu- ally associated with splenomegaly and pale-­colored platelets on peripheral smear. TREATMENT A number of treatment options exist (Table 533.4), but there are no current high-­quality data showing that treatment affects either short-­ or long-­term clinical outcome of ITP in children. Many patients with new-­onset ITP have mild symptoms, with findings limited to petechiae and purpura on the skin, despite severe thrombocytopenia. Compared with untreated controls, treatment appears to be capable of inducing a more rapid rise in platelet count to the presumed safe level of >20 × 109/L, although no data indicate that early therapy prevents ICH.

Thus platelet transfusion in ITP is usually con- traindicated unless life-­threatening bleeding is present. Management guidelines for ITP in children and adults reinforce existing emphasis on prioritizing watchful waiting for spontaneous resolution or outpatient therapy in the uncommon cases for which treatment is needed. Initial approaches to the management of pediatric ITP include the following: 1.	No therapy other than education and counseling of the family and patient for patients with minimal, mild, and moderate symptoms, as defined earlier. This approach emphasizes the usually benign nature of ITP and avoids the therapeutic roller coaster that ensues once in- terventional therapy is begun. This approach is much less costly, and side effects are minimal. Observation is recommended for children with no bleeding or only mild bleeding symptoms such as bruising or petechiae. 2.	Treatment with either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or cor- ticosteroids, particularly for children who present with mucocutane- ous bleeding. IVIG at a dose of 0.8-­1.0 g/kg/day for 1-­2 days induces a rapid rise in platelet count (usually >20 × 109/L) in 95% of pa- tients within 48 hours. IVIG appears to induce a response by down- regulating Fc-­mediated phagocytosis of antibody-­coated platelets. IVIG therapy is both expensive and time-­consuming and typically requires inpatient admission. Additionally, after infusion, there is a risk of headaches and vomiting, suggestive of IVIG-­induced aseptic meningitis. 3.	Corticosteroid therapy has been used for many years to treat acute and chronic ITP in adults and children. Doses of prednisone at 1-­4 mg/kg/day appear to induce a more rapid rise in platelet count than in untreated patients with ITP. Corticosteroid therapy is usually continued for a short course (approximately 5 days) until a rise in platelet count to >20 × 109/L has been achieved to avoid the long-­ term side effects of corticosteroid therapy, especially growth failure, diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis. Each of these medications may also be used to treat subsequent ITP exacerbations/recurrences, which usually occur several weeks after an initial course of therapy in 5–10% of patients. In the special case of ICH, multiple modalities should be used, including platelet transfusion (although not recommended in other bleeding manifestations), IVIG, high-­dose corticosteroids, and prompt consultation by neurosurgery and general surgery (splenectomy). Patients who are bleeding significantly (<5% of children with ITP) should be treated. ICH remains rare, and there are no data showing that treatment actually reduces its incidence. Mucosal bleeding in par- ticular is the most significant in terms of predicting severe bleeding, but specific predictive indices, such as positive or negative predictive values, are not currently well established. The role of splenectomy in ITP should be reserved for one of two circumstances: (1) the older child (≥4 years) with severe ITP that has lasted >1 year (chronic ITP) and whose symptoms are not eas- ily controlled with therapy and/or (2) when life-­threatening hemor- rhage (e.g., ICH) complicates acute ITP if the platelet count cannot be corrected rapidly with transfusion of platelets and administration of IVIG and corticosteroids. Splenectomy is associated with a lifelong risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection caused by encapsulated organisms, increased risk of thrombosis, and the potential develop- ment of pulmonary hypertension in adulthood. As an alternative to splenectomy, rituximab has been used in children to treat chronic ITP. In 30–40% of children, rituximab has induced a partial or complete remission. TPO receptor agonists have also been used to increase plate- let count and are approved for pediatric use. CHRONIC AUTOIMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA Approximately 20% of patients who present with acute ITP have per- sistent thrombocytopenia for >12 months and are said to have chronic ITP. At that time, a careful reevaluation for associated disorders should be performed, especially for autoimmune disease (e.g., SLE), chronic infectious disorders (e.g., HIV), and nonimmune causes of chronic thrombocytopenia, such as type 2B and platelet-­type von Willebrand disease (VWD), X-­linked thrombocytopenia, autoimmune lymphop- roliferative syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency syndrome, autosomal macrothrombocytopenia, and WAS. The presence of coex- isting H. pylori and hepatitis C infection should be considered and, if found, treated. Therapy should be aimed at controlling symptoms and Table 533.4     Treatment Options for Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) PROS CONS COST Observation Does not expose patient to unnecessary medications May increase parent and physician anxiety Relatively inexpensive IVIG Rapid response in most cases IV administration, side effects Expensive Corticosteroids Oral, effective in 70–80% of patients, minimal side effects with short courses Side effects, may not affect long term outcome Inexpensive Rituximab Long-­term remission in 40–60% of patients IV administration, immune sup- pression, potential for reactiva- tion of hepatitis Very expensive Splenectomy Curative in 80% of patients Requires surgery and anesthesia, lifelong risk of infection Expensive Thrombopoietin receptor agonists Potential for oral administration, 40–60% of patients respond Not curative, usually required long term, can cause elevated liver enzymes Very expensive IV, Intravenous; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin.

In ITP, the spleen is the primary site of both antiplatelet antibody synthesis and platelet destruction. Splenec- tomy is successful in inducing complete remission in 64–88% of chil- dren with chronic ITP. This effect must be balanced against the lifelong risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection and/or thrombosis. This decision is often affected by quality-­of-­life issues, as well as the ease with which the child can be managed using medical therapy, such as IVIG, corticosteroids, IV anti-­D, or rituximab. Two effective agents that act to stimulate thrombopoiesis, romiplostim and eltrombopag (see Fig. 533.1), are approved to treat adults and children with chronic ITP. Although these do not address the mechanism of action of ITP, the increase in platelet count may be enough to compensate for the increased destruction and allow the patient to have resolution of bleed- ing and maintain a platelet count >50 × 109/L.

Flood A number of drugs are associated with immune thrombocytopenia as the result of either an immune process or megakaryocyte injury. Some common drugs used in pediatrics that cause thrombocytopenia include valproic acid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, sulfonamides, van- comycin, and trimethoprim-­sulfamethoxazole. Most of these drugs may affect platelet function as well as the count itself. Heparin-­induced thrombocytopenia (and rarely an associated thrombosis) is seldom seen in pediatrics, but it occurs when, after exposure to heparin, the patient has an antibody directed against the heparin–platelet factor 4 complex. Recommended treatment for heparin-­induced thrombocyto- penia includes direct thrombin inhibitors such as argatroban or bivali- rudin and removal of all sources of heparin, including central venous catheter line flushes.

Flood The syndromes of DIC (see Chapter 532), HUS (see Chapter 560.5), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (see Chapter 533.5) share the hematologic picture of a thrombotic microangiopathy in which there exists RBC destruction and consumptive thrombocytopenia caused by platelet and fibrin deposition in the microvasculature. The microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is characterized by the presence of RBC fragments, including helmet cells, schistocytes, spherocytes, and burr cells. 533.4  Hemolytic-­Uremic Syndrome See Chapter 560.5. 533.5  Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by the pentad of fever, microangio- pathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, abnormal renal function, and central nervous system (CNS) changes; TTP is clinically similar to HUS (Table 533.5). Although TTP can be congenital, the acquired form is more common and usually presents in adults and occasionally in adolescents. Microvascular thrombi within the CNS cause subtle, shifting neurologic signs that vary from changes in affect and orien- tation to aphasia, blindness, and seizures. Initial manifestations are often nonspecific (weakness, pain, emesis), and prompt recognition of this disorder is critical. Laboratory findings provide important clues to the diagnosis and show microangiopathic hemolytic anemia charac- terized by morphologically abnormal RBCs, with schistocytes, sphe- rocytes, helmet cells, and an elevated reticulocyte count in association with thrombocytopenia. Coagulation studies are usually nondiagnostic. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are sometimes elevated. The treat- ment of acquired TTP is plasmapheresis (plasma exchange), which is effective in 80–95% of patients. Treatment with plasmapheresis should be instituted on the basis of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia even if other symptoms are not yet present because of the high mortality (80–90%) in patients without timely intervention. Rituximab, corticosteroids, and splenectomy are reserved for refractory cases. Caplacizumab, an anti-­VWF humanized immunoglobulin, blocks the interaction of ultralarge (i.e., most likely to bind platelets) VWF mul- timers with platelets, and many result in rapid resolution of acute TTP. The majority of cases of TTP are acquired, caused by an autoantibody-­ mediated deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotein- ase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13) that is responsible for cleaving the high-­molecular-­weight multimers of VWF and appears to play a pivotal role in the evolution of the thrombotic microangiopa- thy (Fig. 533.4) that results in a preponderance of ultralarge multim- ers that more adeptly bind platelets, triggering the microangiopathy. In contrast, levels of ADAMTS13 in HUS are usually normal. Congenital ADAMTS13 deficiency causes rare familial cases of TTP/HUS, usually manifested as recurrent episodes of thrombocytope- nia, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, and renal involvement, with or with- out neurologic changes, that often present in infancy in the context of an intercurrent illness. Treatment of hereditary TTP with recombinant ADAMTS13 has been successful when patients are refractory to fresh frozen plasma therapy. Abnormalities of the complement system have now also been implicated in rare cases of familial TTP. ADAMTS13 deficiency can be treated by repeated infusions of fresh-­frozen plasma.

The association of a giant hemangioma with localized intravascu- lar coagulation causing consumptive thrombocytopenia and hypofi- brinogenemia is called Kasabach-­Merritt syndrome. In most patients, the site of the hemangioma is obvious, but retroperitoneal and intra-­ abdominal hemangiomas may require body imaging for detection. Platelet trapping and activation of coagulation occurs inside the hem- angioma, with fibrinogen consumption and generation of fibrin(ogen) degradation products. Arteriovenous malformation within the lesions can cause heart failure. Pathologically, Kasabach-­Merritt syndrome appears to develop more often as a result of a kaposiform hemangioen- dothelioma or tufted hemangioma rather than a simple hemangioma. The peripheral blood smear shows microangiopathic changes. Multiple modalities have been used to treat Kasabach-­Merritt syn- drome, including propranolol, surgical excision (if possible), laser photocoagulation, high-­dose corticosteroids, local radiation therapy, antiangiogenic agents such as interferon-­α2, and vincristine. Over time, most patients who present in infancy have regression of the hem- angioma. Treatment of the associated coagulopathy may benefit from a trial of antifibrinolytic therapy with ε-­aminocaproic acid (Amicar) or anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin.

Flood Thrombocytopenia develops in individuals with massive splenomeg- aly, such as those with portal vein thrombosis or liver disease, because the spleen acts as a reservoir for platelets and may sequester a large number of them. Most such patients also have mild leukopenia and anemia on CBC. Individuals who have thrombocytopenia caused by splenic sequestration should undergo a workup to diagnose the etiol- ogy of splenomegaly, including infectious, inflammatory, infiltrative, neoplastic, obstructive, and hemolytic causes. 533.8  Congenital Thrombocytopenic Syndromes Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood See Table 533.2. Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) usually manifests within the first few days to week of life, when the child pres- ents with petechiae and purpura caused by profound thrombocytope- nia. CAMT is caused by a rare defect in hematopoiesis as a result of pathogenic variants in the MPL gene that encodes the stem cell TPO receptor. Other than skin and mucous membrane abnormalities, find- ings on physical examination are normal. Examination of the bone marrow shows an absence of megakaryocytes. These patients often progress to marrow failure (aplasia). Hematopoietic stem cell trans- plantation (HSCT) is curative. Thrombocytopenia–absent radius (TAR) syndrome consists of thrombocytopenia (absence or hypoplasia of megakaryocytes) that presents in early infancy with bilateral radial anomalies of variable severity, ranging from mild changes to marked limb shortening (Fig. 533.5). Many such individuals also have other skeletal abnormalities of the ulna, radius, and lower extremities. Present thumbs help to dif- ferentiate this disorder from Fanconi anemia. Intolerance to cow’s milk formula (present in 50%) may complicate management by triggering gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, increased thrombocytopenia, eosino- philia, and a leukemoid reaction. The thrombocytopenia of TAR syn- drome frequently remits over the first few years of life. The molecular basis of TAR syndrome is linked to RBM8A. A few patients have been reported to have a syndrome of amegakaryocytic thrombocytope- nia with radioulnar synostosis caused by a pathogenic variant in the HOXA11 gene. In contrast to TAR syndrome, this clinical disorder presents with marrow aplasia. WAS is characterized by microthrombocytopenia, with tiny plate- lets, eczema, and recurrent infection as a consequence of immune defi- ciency (see Chapter 165.2). WAS is inherited as an X-­linked disorder, and the gene implicated in WAS has been identified. The WAS protein appears to play an integral role in regulating the cytoskeletal archi- tecture of both platelets and T lymphocytes in response to receptor-­ mediated cell signaling. The WAS protein is common to all cells of hematopoietic lineage. Molecular analysis of families with X-­linked thrombocytopenia has shown that many affected members have a sin- gle nucleotide pathogenic variant within the WAS gene, whereas indi- viduals with the full manifestation of WAS have large gene deletions. Examination of the bone marrow in WAS shows the normal number of megakaryocytes, although they may have bizarre morphologic features. Transfused platelets have a normal life span in these patients. Splenec- tomy often corrects the thrombocytopenia, suggesting that the plate- lets formed in WAS have accelerated destruction. After splenectomy, these patients are at increased risk for overwhelming infection and require lifelong antibiotic prophylaxis against encapsulated organisms. Approximately 5–15% of patients with WAS develop lymphoreticular malignancies (involving mostly leukemias and lymphomas). Successful HSCT from an unaffected donor cures WAS. X-­linked macrothrom- bocytopenia and dyserythropoiesis have been linked to pathogenic variants in GATA1, which encodes an erythroid and megakaryocytic transcription factor. MYH9-­related thrombocytopenias include a number of diverse hereditary thrombocytopenia syndromes (e.g., Sebastian, Epstein, May-­Hegglin, Fechtner) characterized by autosomal dominant mac- rothrombocytopenia, neutrophil inclusion bodies, and a variety of physical anomalies, including sensorineural deafness, renal disease, and eye disease. These have all been shown to be caused by different pathogenic variants in the MYH9 gene (nonmuscle myosin-­IIa heavy chain 9). The thrombocytopenia is usually mild and not progressive. Some other individuals with recessively inherited macrothrombocyto- penia have abnormalities in chromosome 22q11. Pathogenic variants in the gene for glycoprotein Ibβ, an essential component of the platelet VWF receptor, can result in Bernard-­Soulier syndrome (see Chapter 533.13), a macrothrombocytopenic disease. A diagnostic approach to genetic platelet disorders is noted in Figure 533.6. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

The von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers facilitate platelet ad- hesion to the subendothelium by binding to exposed connective tissue and then to platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). In flowing blood shear stress unfolds ultralarge VWF multimers in the platelet-­rich thrombus and ena- bles ADAMTS13 to cleave a specific Tyr-­Met bond in the second of the three A domains in VWF subunits. Cleavage reduces VWF multimer size and limits thrombus growth. In the absence of ADAMTS13, VWF-­ dependent platelet accumulation continues and eventually results in microvascular thrombosis and TTP.

Chapter 533  u  Platelet and Blood Vessel Disorders  3057 533.9  Neonatal Thrombocytopenia Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood Thrombocytopenia in the newborn rarely is indicative of a primary disorder of megakaryopoiesis. It is usually the result of systemic illness or transfer of maternal antibodies directed against fetal platelets (see Table 533.3). Neonatal thrombocytopenia often occurs in association with congenital viral infections, especially rubella, cytomegalovirus, protozoal infection (e.g., toxoplasmosis), and syphilis, and perinatal bacterial infections, especially those caused by gram-­negative bacilli. Thrombocytopenia associated with DIC may be responsible for severe spontaneous bleeding. The constellation of marked thrombocytopenia and abnormal abdominal findings is common in necrotizing entero- colitis and other causes of necrotic bowel. Thrombocytopenia in an ill child requires a prompt search for viral and bacterial pathogens. Antibody-­mediated thrombocytopenia in the newborn occurs because of transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies directed against fetal platelets. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is caused by the development of maternal antibodies against paternally inherited antigens present on fetal platelets that are recog- nized as foreign by the maternal immune system. The incidence of NATP is 1/4,000-­5,000 live births. The clinical manifestations of NAIT are those of an apparently well child who, within the first few days after delivery, has generalized petechiae and purpura. Laboratory studies show a normal maternal platelet count but moderate to severe throm- bocytopenia in the newborn. Detailed review of the history should show no evidence of maternal thrombocytopenia. Up to 30% of infants with severe NAIT may have ICH, either prenatally or in the perinatal period. Unlike Rh disease, first pregnancies may be severely affected. Subsequent pregnancies are often more severely affected than the first. The diagnosis of NAIT is made by checking for the presence of maternal alloantibodies directed against the father’s platelets. Specific studies can be done to identify the target alloantigen. The most com- mon cause is incompatibility for the platelet alloantigen HPA-­1a. Spe- cific DNA sequence polymorphisms have been identified that permit informative prenatal testing to identify at-­risk pregnancies. The differ- ential diagnosis of NAIT includes transplacental transfer of maternal IgG antiplatelet autoantibodies (maternal ITP), and, more commonly, viral or bacterial infection. Treatment of NAIT requires the administration of IVIG prena- tally to the mother if the status is known before birth. Therapy usu- ally begins in the second trimester and is continued throughout the pregnancy. Fetal platelet count can be monitored by percutaneous umbilical blood sampling. Delivery should be performed by cesarean section to reduce risk for ICH from vaginal delivery. After delivery, if severe thrombocytopenia persists, transfusion of platelets that share the maternal alloantigens (e.g., washed maternal platelets) will cause a rise in platelet counts to provide effective hemostasis. However, a ran- dom donor platelet transfusion is more likely to be readily available. Some centers have units available that may lack the antigens most often involved. After there has been one affected child, genetic counseling is critical to inform the parents of the high risk of thrombocytopenia in subsequent pregnancies. Children born to mothers with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (maternal ITP) appear to have a lower risk of serious hemorrhage than infants born with NAIT, although severe thrombocytopenia may occur. The mother’s preexisting platelet count may have some predic- tive value in that severe maternal thrombocytopenia before delivery appears to predict a higher risk of fetal thrombocytopenia. In mothers who have had splenectomy for ITP, the maternal platelet count may be normal and is not predictive of fetal thrombocytopenia. Treatment includes prenatal administration of corticosteroids to the mother and IVIG and sometimes corticosteroids to the infant after delivery. Thrombocytopenia in an infant, whether a result of NAIT or maternal ITP, usually resolves within 2-­4 months after delivery. The period of highest risk is the immediate perinatal period. Two syndromes of congenital failure of platelet production often present in the newborn period. In CAMT the newborn manifests petechiae and purpura shortly after birth. Findings on physical exami- nation are otherwise normal. Megakaryocytes are absent from the bone marrow. This syndrome is caused by a pathogenic variant in the megakaryocyte TPO receptor that is essential for development of all hematopoietic cell lines. Pancytopenia eventually develops, and HSCT is curative. TAR syndrome consists of thrombocytopenia that pres- ents in early infancy, with bilateral radial anomalies of variable severity, ranging from mild changes to marked limb shortening. It frequently remits over the first few years of life (see Chapter 533.8 and Fig. 533.5). Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.

Fig. 2.) 533.10  Thrombocytopenia From Acquired Disorders Causing Decreased Production Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood Disorders of the bone marrow that inhibit megakaryopoiesis usually affect RBC and WBC production. Infiltrative disorders, including malig- nancies, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia, histiocytosis, lymphomas, and storage disease, usually cause either abnormalities on physical exam- ination (lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or masses), abnormali- ties of the WBC count, or anemia. Aplastic processes may present as isolated thrombocytopenia, although there are usually clues on the CBC (leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, or macrocytosis). Children with con- stitutional aplastic anemia (Fanconi anemia) often (but not always) have abnormalities on examination, including radial and/or thumb anoma- lies, other skeletal anomalies, short stature, microcephaly, and hyper- pigmentation. Bone marrow examination should be performed when thrombocytopenia is associated with abnormalities found on physical examination or on examination of the other blood cell lines. 533.11  Platelet Function Disorders Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood There is no simple and reliable test to screen for abnormal platelet function. Bleeding time and the platelet function analyzer (PFA-­100) have been used, but neither has sufficient sensitivity or specificity to rule in or rule out a platelet defect, especially one with mild-­moderate phenotypic expression. Bleeding time measures the interaction of platelets with the blood vessel wall and thus is affected by both plate- let count and platelet function. The predictive value of bleeding time is problematic because bleeding time is dependent on other factors, including the technician’s skill and the patient’s cooperation, often a challenge in the infant or young child; it is not recommended in high resource settings. The PFA-­100 measures platelet adhesion and aggre- gation in whole blood at high shear when the blood is exposed to either collagen-­epinephrine or collagen-­ADP. Results are reported as the closure time in seconds. The use of the PFA-­100 as a screening test remains controversial. For patients with a positive history of bleeding suggestive of VWD or platelet dysfunction, specific VWF testing and platelet function studies should be done, irrespective of the results of the bleeding time or PFA-­100. Platelet function in the clinical laboratory is measured using platelet aggregometry. In the aggregometer, agonists, such as collagen, ADP, ris- tocetin, epinephrine, arachidonic acid, and thrombin (or the thrombin receptor peptide), are added to platelet-­rich plasma, and the clumping of platelets over time is measured by an automated machine through either light transmission or electric impedance. At the same time, other instruments measure the release of granular contents, such as ATP, from the platelets after activation. The ability of platelets to aggregate and their metabolic activity can thus be assessed simultaneously. When a patient is being evaluated for possible platelet dysfunction, it is criti- cally important to exclude the presence of other exogenous agents and to study the patient, if possible, off all medications for 2 weeks, espe- cially those with any potential antiplatelet effects. Further evaluation using flow cytometric analysis of surface receptors or molecular and/or genetic testing is often necessary to make a more definitive diagnosis.

Flood A number of systemic illnesses are associated with platelet dysfunc- tion, most frequently liver disease, kidney disease (uremia), and dis- orders that trigger increased amounts of fibrin degradation products. These disorders frequently cause prolonged bleeding time and are often associated with other abnormalities of the coagulation mechanism. The most important element of management is to treat the primary ill- ness.

Chapter 533  u  Platelet and Blood Vessel Disorders  3059 533.13  Congenital Abnormalities of Platelet Function Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H. Flood Severe platelet function defects usually present with petechiae and purpura shortly after birth, especially after vaginal delivery (see Table 533.2). Defects in the platelet GPIb complex (the VWF receptor) or the αIIb-­β3 complex (the fibrinogen receptor) cause severe congenital platelet dysfunction. Although laboratory tests of platelet function are available, molecular characterization by genetic testing is rapidly pro- gressing for platelet disorders. Bernard-­Soulier syndrome, a severe congenital platelet func- tion disorder, is caused by absence or severe deficiency of the GPIb complex (VWF receptor) on the platelet membrane. This syndrome is characterized by a macrothrombocytopenia, with giant platelets and greatly prolonged bleeding time (>20 min) or PFA-­100 closure time. Patients may have significant mucocutane- ous and GI bleeding. Platelet aggregation tests classically demon- strate absent ristocetin-­induced platelet aggregation but normal aggregation to all other agonists. Ristocetin induces the binding of VWF to platelets and agglutinates platelets. Results of stud- ies of VWF antigen and activity are normal. The GPIb complex interacts with the platelet cytoskeleton; a defect in this interaction is believed to be the cause of the large platelet size. This recep- tor deficiency can also be detected by flow cytometry. Bernard-­ Soulier syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. Causative pathogenic variants are usually identified in the genes encoding the GPIb complex of glycoproteins Ibα, Ibβ, V, and IX. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a congenital disorder associated with severe platelet dysfunction that yields prolonged bleeding time and a normal platelet count. Platelets have normal size and morphologic fea- tures on the peripheral blood smear, and closure times for PFA-­100 or bleeding time are extremely abnormal. Aggregation studies classically demonstrate abnormal or absent aggregation with all agonists used except ristocetin because ristocetin agglutinates platelets and does not require a metabolically active platelet. This disorder is caused by defi- ciency of the platelet fibrinogen receptor αIIb-­β3, the major integrin complex on the platelet surface that undergoes conformational changes by inside-­out signaling when platelets are activated. This receptor defi- ciency can also be detected by flow cytometry. Fibrinogen binds to this complex when the platelet is activated and causes platelets to aggregate. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is caused by pathogenic variants in the genes for αIIb or β3 and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. For both Bernard-­Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann thrombasthenia, the diagnosis is confirmed by flow cytometry of the patient’s platelet gly- coproteins. Bleeding in Glanzmann thrombasthenia may be quite severe and is typically mucocutaneous, including epistaxis, gingival, and GI bleeding. There are reports of curative therapy using stem cell transplant. Hereditary deficiency of platelet storage granules occurs in two well-­characterized but rare syndromes that involve deficiency of intracytoplasmic granules. Dense granule deficiency is character- ized by absence of the granules that contain ADP, ATP, Ca2+, and serotonin. This disorder is diagnosed by the finding that ATP is not released on platelet aggregation studies and ideally is characterized by transmission electron microscopic studies. Hermansky-­Pudlak syndrome (with nine subtypes) is a dense granule deficiency caused by defects in lysosomal storage. Affected patients present with oculocutaneous albinism and hemorrhage caused by the platelet defect; some patients also develop granulomatous colitis resembling Table 533.6     Comparison of Nine Types of Hermansky-­Pudlak Syndrome 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Oculocu- taneous albinism Variable, mild-­ moderate: brown to white hair Severe: lack of hair and iris pigment Mild-­ moderate: light skin pigment Severe: blonde hair, gray iris Variable: light-­ brown hair, brown iris Variable: iris hetero- chromia Variable Variable: tan skin, silver hair, brown iris Pale skin, silver-­ blonde hair, pale-­ blue iris Platelet defect/ bruising + + + + + + + + + Granuloma- tous colitis + − − + − + + − − Pulmonary fibrosis/ ILD + + − + − − − − − Other symptoms Neutropenia Failure to thrive Hypothyroidism CAH Depression High cholesterol Cutaneous infections +, Present; −, absent; CAH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia; ILD, interstitial lung disease. desmopressin have been helpful in augmenting hemostasis and cor- recting bleeding time. In some patients, transfusions of platelets and cryoprecipitate have also been helpful in improving hemostasis. Many medications alter platelet function. The most common drug in adults that alters platelet function is acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Aspi- rin irreversibly acetylates the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is critical in the formation of thromboxane A2. Aspirin usually causes moderate platelet dysfunction that becomes more prominent if there is another abnormality of the hemostatic mechanism. In children, common drugs that reversibly inhibit platelet function include other nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), valproic acid, and high-­dose penicillin. Specific agents to inhibit platelet function therapeutically include those that block the platelet ADP receptor (clopidogrel) and αIIb-­β3 receptor antagonists, as well as aspirin.

Chédiak-­Higashi syndrome also presents with a dense granule defect, immune dysfunction, and albinism. Gray platelet syndrome is caused by the absence of platelet α granules, result- ing in large platelets that are large and appear gray on Wright stain of peripheral blood. In this rare syndrome, aggregation and release are absent with most agonists other than thrombin and ristocetin. Transmission electron microscopic studies are diagnostic. Auto- somal recessive gray platelet syndrome is caused by defects in the NBEAL2 gene, while autosomal dominant disease is associated with a pathogenic variant in GFI1B. This disorder may also be associ- ated with familial leukemia. Quebec platelet syndrome is caused by degradation of platelet α granules caused by defects in PLAU, which encodes a urokinase-­type plasminogen activator. Treatment usually involves antifibrinolytic therapy. OTHER HEREDITARY DISORDERS OF PLATELET FUNCTION Abnormalities in the pathways of platelet signaling/activation and release of granular contents cause a heterogeneous group of platelet function defects that are usually manifested as increased bruising, epistaxis, and menorrhagia. Symptoms may be subtle and are often made more obvious by high-­risk surgery, such as tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, or by administration of NSAIDs. In the laboratory, bleeding time is variable, and closure time as measured by the PFA-­ 100 is frequently, but not always, prolonged. Platelet aggregation studies show deficient aggregation with one or two agonists and/or abnormal release of granular contents. The formation of thromboxane from arachidonic acid (AA) after the activation of phospholipase is critical to normal platelet function. Deficiency or dysfunction of enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthase, which metabolize AA, causes abnormal plate- let function. In the aggregometer, platelets from such patients do not aggregate in response to AA. The most common platelet function defects are those character- ized by variable bleeding time/PFA closure times and abnormal aggregation with one or two agonists, usually ADP and/or colla- gen. Some of these individuals have only decreased release of ATP from intracytoplasmic granules; the significance of this finding is debated. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PLATELET DYSFUNCTION Successful treatment depends on the severity of both the diagno- sis and the hemorrhagic event. In all but severe platelet function defects, desmopressin, 0.3 μg/kg intravenously, may be used for mild to moderate bleeding episodes. In addition to its effect on stimulating levels of VWF and factor VIII, desmopressin corrects bleeding time and augments hemostasis in many individuals with mild to moderate platelet function defects. Antifibrinolytic therapy may be useful for mucosal bleeds. For individuals with Bernard-­ Soulier syndrome or Glanzmann thrombasthenia, platelet trans- fusions of 0.5-­1 unit single donor platelets correct the defect in hemostasis and may be lifesaving. Rarely, alloantibodies develop to the deficient platelet protein, rendering the patient refractory to the transfused platelets. In such patients, the use of recombinant factor VIIa has been effective, and this treatment was recently approved for platelet-­refractory Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. In both condi- tions, HSCT has been curative. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. 533.14  Disorders of the Blood Vessels Brian R. Branchford and Veronica H.

Thereafter, it enlarges until puberty, reaching an average weight of 150 g, and then dimin- ishes in size during adulthood. Approximately 15% of patients will have an accessory spleen. The major splenic components are a lym- phoid compartment (white pulp) and a filtering system (red pulp). The white pulp consists of periarterial lymphatic sheaths (PALS; T-­zone) of T lymphocytes with embedded germinal centers con- taining B lymphocytes.

The splenic capsule contains smooth muscle and contracts in response to epinephrine. Approximately 10% of the blood delivered to the spleen flows rapidly through a closed vascular network. The other 90% flows more slowly through an open system (the splenic cords), where it is filtered through 1-­5 μm slits before entering the splenic sinuses.

It can retain much more when it enlarges, leading to cytopenias. Hematopoiesis in the red pulp is a major splenic func- tion at 3-­6 months of fetal life but subsequently disappears. Splenic hematopoiesis can be resumed in patients with myelofibrosis or severe hemolytic anemia. Factor VIII, iron, plasmablasts, plasma cells, and one third of the circulating platelet mass are sequestered in the spleen and can be released by stress or epinephrine stimu- lation. Thrombocytosis and leukocytosis occur with loss of the splenic reservoir function. A high platelet count after the loss of splenic function or splenectomy is not associated with an increased risk of thrombosis in children. Slow blood flow past macrophages and through small openings in the sinus walls facilitates the filtering functions of the spleen removing any particles >1 micron in size from the circulation. Excess membrane is removed from young red blood cells (RBCs) and loss of this function is characterized by target cells, poikilo- cytosis, and decreased osmotic fragility. The spleen is the primary site for destruction of old RBCs, and this function is assumed by other reticuloendothelial cells after splenectomy. The spleen also removes damaged/abnormal RBCs (e.g., spherocytes, antibody-­ coated RBCs) and damaged/senescent platelets. Intracytoplasmic inclusions may be removed from RBCs without cell lysis. Func- tional or anatomic hyposplenia is characterized by continued circu- lation of cells containing nuclear remnants (Howell-­Jolly bodies), denatured hemoglobin (Heinz bodies), and other debris in RBCs. This debris may appear as “pits” on indirect microscopy. The spleen plays a large role in host defense against infection. Mechanical filtration occurs removing parasitized erythrocytes, as well as unopsonized bacteria. The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the body and contains almost half the body’s total immunoglobulin-­ producing B lymphocytes. The spleen processes foreign material to stimulate production of opsonizing antibody. Upon antigenic chal- lenge, B and T cells are developed in the spleen, with subsequent release of immunoglobulins. Production of immune-­mediating pro- teins important in bacterial clearance occurs in the spleen including complement, opsonins, properdin, and tuftsin. Thus young (nonim- mune) or hyposplenic individuals are at increased risk for sepsis caused by pneumococci and other encapsulated bacteria. The spleen can also use phagocytosis to trap and destroy intracellular parasites. The spleen has a minor role in antibody response to intramuscularly or subcutaneously injected antigens but is required for early antibody production after exposure to intravenous antigens. Additionally, the spleen is important in the pathogenesis of immune-­mediated cyto- penias (IMCs). Antibody-­coated platelets or erythrocytes are phago- cytosed via mechanisms associated with splenic macrophages. The spleen also serves as a reservoir for antibody producing plasma cells involved in IMCs. Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS A soft, thin spleen is palpable in 15% of neonates, 10% of normal children, and 5% of adolescents. In most individuals, the spleen must be 2-­3 times its normal size before it is palpable. The spleen is best examined when standing on the right side of a supine patient Chapter 535 Splenomegaly Allison S. Remiker and Amanda M. Brandow by palpating across the abdomen as the patient inspires deeply or with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position. A splenic edge felt more than 2 cm below the left costal margin is abnormal. An enlarged spleen might descend into the pelvis; when spleno- megaly is suspected, the abdominal examination should begin at a lower starting point. Superficial abdominal venous distention may be present when splenomegaly is a result of portal hypertension. Patients may also complain of left upper quadrant pain as the spleen enlarges. Radiologic detection or confirmation of splenic enlarge- ment is done with ultrasonography, CT, MRI, positron emission tomography, or technetium-­99m sulfur colloid scan. The latter also assesses splenic function. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Table 535.1 lists specific causes of splenomegaly. A thorough history with a focus on systemic complaints (e.g., fever, night sweats, mal- aise, weight loss) and a complete physical examination (with special attention to lymphadenopathy, jaundice, hepatomegaly, rashes, joint swelling, petechiae, ecchymoses), in combination with a complete blood count and careful review of the peripheral smear, can help guide diagnosis. Pseudosplenomegaly Abnormally long mesenteric connections may produce a wander- ing or ptotic spleen. An enlarged left lobe of the liver, a left upper quadrant mass, or a splenic hematoma may be mistaken for sple- nomegaly. Splenic cysts may contribute to splenomegaly or mimic it; these may be congenital (epidermoid) or acquired (pseudocyst) after trauma or infarction. Cysts are usually asymptomatic and are found on radiologic evaluation. Splenosis after splenic rupture or an accessory spleen (present in 15% of normal individuals) may also mimic splenomegaly; most are not palpable. The syndrome of congenital polysplenism includes cardiac defects, left-­sided organ anomalies, bilobed lungs, biliary atresia, and pseudosplenomegaly (see Chapter 480.11). Hypersplenism Increased splenic function (sequestration or destruction of circulat- ing cells) can result in peripheral blood cytopenias (thrombocyto- penia, neutropenia, anemia), increased bone marrow activity, and splenomegaly. It is usually secondary to another disease and may be cured by treatment of the underlying condition or, if absolutely necessary, may be moderated by splenectomy. Table 535.1 lists the most common diseases associated with massive splenomegaly. Congestive Splenomegaly Splenomegaly may result from obstruction in the hepatic, portal, or splenic veins leading to hypersplenism. Wilson disease (see Chapter 405.2), galactosemia (see Chapter 107.2), biliary atresia (see Chap- ter 404.1), and α1-­antitrypsin deficiency (see Chapter 405) may result in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular obstruction. Congenital abnormalities (absence or hypoplasia) of the portal or splenic veins may cause vascular obstruction. Septic omphalitis or thrombophlebitis (spontaneous or as a result of umbilical venous catheterization in neonates) may result in secondary obliteration of these vessels. Splenic venous flow may be obstructed by masses of sickled erythrocytes leading to infarction. When the spleen is the site of vascular obstruction, splenectomy cures hypersplen- ism. However, because obstruction usually is in the hepatic or por- tal systems, portacaval shunting may be more helpful since both portal hypertension and thrombocytopenia contribute to variceal bleeding.

Chapter 536  u  Hyposplenism, Splenic Trauma, and Splenectomy  3063 HYPOSPLENISM Congenital absence (asplenia) or underdevelopment (hyposplenia) of the spleen is associated with complex cyanotic heart defects, dex- trocardia, bilateral trilobed lungs, and heterotopic abdominal organs (Ivemark syndrome; see Chapter 480.11). Patients with isolated con- genital asplenia have pathogenic variants in RPSA in ∼40% of cases. Right atrial isomerism (Ivemark syndrome), a form of heterotaxy, may have asplenia associated with pathogenic variants of GDF1. Splenic function is usually normal in children with congenital polysplenia. Functional hyposplenism may occur in normal neonates, especially premature infants. Children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (see Chapter 511.1) may have splenic hypofunction as early as 6 months of age. In this setting, the spleen eventually autoinfarcts and becomes fibrotic and permanently nonfunctional. Functional hyposplenism may also occur in malaria (see Chapter 334), after irradiation to the left upper quadrant, and when the reticuloendothelial function of the spleen is overwhelmed (as in severe hemolytic anemia or metabolic storage disease). Thrombosis of the splenic/celiac arteries or splenic vein is associated with functional hyposplenism. Splenic hypofunction has been reported occasionally in patients with autoimmune diseases (i.e., juvenile idiopathic arthritis, lupus, sarcoidosis), nephritis, inflam- matory bowel disease, celiac disease, chronic hepatitis, Pearson syn- drome, Fanconi anemia, those with use of high-­dose corticosteroids, and graft-­versus-­host disease (Table 536.1). Splenic hypofunction is characterized by red blood cell (RBC) inclusions in peripheral blood smears (Howell-­Jolly or Heinz bodies), “pits” on interference microscopy, and poor uptake of technetium or other spleen scans (Table 536.2 and Fig. 536.1). Reduced immuno- globulin M memory B cells may also be detected and is a risk factor for overwhelming sepsis. Patients with functional hyposplenism or asplenia are at increased risk for sepsis from encapsulated bacteria and benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis and urgent evaluation when febrile. SPLENIC TRAUMA Injury to the spleen may occur with abdominal trauma. Small splenic capsular tears may cause abdominal or referred left shoulder pain as a result of diaphragmatic irritation by blood. Larger tears result in more severe blood loss, with similar pain and signs of hypovolemic shock. Previously enlarged spleens (as in patients with infectious mononucle- osis) are more likely to rupture with minor trauma. Patients with sple- nomegaly should avoid contact sports and other activities that increase the risk of splenic trauma. CT scan with intravenous contrast is the best imaging modality to assess splenic trauma in a hemodynamically stable patient. In emergent situations extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (E-­FAST) should be considered as an ini- tial evaluation, although the sensitivity and specificity in children is variable. Treatment of a small capsular injury should include careful obser- vation with attention to changes in vital signs or abdominal findings, serial hemoglobin determinations, and the availability of prompt surgi- cal intervention if a patient's condition deteriorates (see Chapter 80). RBC transfusion requirements should be minimal (<25 mL/kg/48 hr). These patients are usually hospitalized for 10-­14 days and have their activities restricted for months. Laparotomy, with or without splenec- tomy, is indicated for more marked abdominal bleeding, in patients who have clinical instability or deterioration, or when other organ damage is suspected. Partial splenectomy and splenic repair should be substituted for total splenectomy when feasible to maintain some splenic immune function. Nonoperative management is typically possible in >90% of patients. Delayed splenic rupture is quite rare in children. SPLENECTOMY Splenectomy should be limited to specific indications where medical therapy is (or has been) ineffective. These include traumatic splenic rupture, anatomic defects, splenic malignancy (i.e., splenic marginal zone lymphoma [SMZL]), severe transfusion-­dependent hemolytic anemia, refractory and severe immune-­mediated cytopenias, meta- bolic storage diseases, and secondary hypersplenism. There are certain conditions where splenectomy should be avoided because of increased risk of complications and/or better alternative treatments. These include autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), heredi- tary stomatocytosis (HSt), hereditary xerocytosis (HX), cold agglutinin disease (CAD), paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH), Gaucher dis- ease, and thrombocytopenia in hepatic cirrhosis. The major long-­term risk of splenectomy is sudden, overwhelming postsplenectomy infections (sepsis or meningitis). This risk is especially high in children <5 years old at surgery. The risk of sepsis is less when splenectomy is performed for trauma, RBC membrane defects, and immune thrombocytopenia (2–4%) than when there is sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, or a preexist- ing immune deficiency (Wiskott-­Aldrich syndrome, Hodgkin disease) or reticuloendothelial blockade (storage disease, severe hemolytic ane- mia) (8–30%). The overall risk is 2-­5 per 1,000 asplenic patient-­years, Chapter 536 Hyposplenism, Splenic Trauma, and Splenectomy Allison S. Remiker and Amanda M.

All rights reserved. 3064  Part XIX  u  Diseases of the Blood with a lifelong risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infections of 5%; more than half occur within 2 years after splenectomy, although the risk remains lifelong. The use of laparoscopic splenectomy has decreased surgical morbidity and hospitalization time. Encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (>60% of cases), Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, account for >80% of cases of postsplenectomy sepsis. Because the spleen is respon- sible for filtering the blood and for early antibody responses, sepsis (with or without meningitis) can progress rapidly, leading to death within 12-­24 hours of onset. Febrile splenectomized patients should be evaluated and treated promptly with antibiotics to cover the organisms previously mentioned. This treatment should be initiated at home if access to definitive medical care will be delayed. Common empiric anti- biotics include amoxicillin-­clavulanate or cefdinir. A broad-­spectrum cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) is recommended until spe- cific antibiotic susceptibility and presence, or absence of meningitis is known. Vancomycin (to cover penicillin-­resistant pneumococci) should be initiated, depending on the illness severity and susceptibili- ties of pneumococci at the institution. Splenectomized patients are also at increased risk for contracting protozoal infections, such as malaria and babesiosis. Serious infections may occur after an animal bite or lick (particularly dogs) and is caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus or C. cynodegmi. Prophylactic antibiotics should be given after a bite poten- tially to prevent sepsis caused by these organisms (see Chapter 765). Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management may decrease the risk of postsplenectomy infection. It is important to be certain of the need for splenectomy and, if possible, to postpone the operation until the patient is ≥5 years of age. Pneumococcal, meningo- coccal, and H. influenzae conjugate vaccines given at least 14 days before splenectomy may reduce postsplenectomy sepsis. The 7-­valent (PCV7) was replaced by the 13-­valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-­protein conju- gate vaccine (PCV13). Thus, depending on what primary pneumococcal vaccine was given, a single dose of PCV13 may be recommended. In addition, the 23-­valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneu- movax) should be given at age ≥2 years and a second dose 5 years later. Yearly influenza vaccine should also be given because influenza infection is a risk factor for secondary pneumococcal infections. Prophylaxis with oral penicillin VK (125 mg twice daily for children <5 years old; 250 mg twice daily for children ≥5 years) should be given until at least 5 years of age and for at least 2 years after splenectomy. Although the greatest risk is in the immediate postoperative period, reports of deaths occurring years after splenectomy suggest that the risk (and the need for prophy- laxis) may be lifelong. Lifelong prophylaxis should be strongly consid- ered in patients who have had an invasive pneumococcal infection or who have an underlying immune deficiency. In children with sickle cell disease, penicillin prophylaxis should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made. Prophylaxis may be continued into adulthood for higher-­risk patients, including those with a history of pneumococcal sepsis, but effectiveness in this older group has not been well documented. In patients with traumatic injury, splenic repair or partial splenec- tomy should be considered in an attempt to preserve splenic function. Partial splenectomy or partial splenic embolization may be sufficient to ameliorate some forms of hemolytic anemia. Up to 50% of children whose spleen is removed because of trauma have spontaneous spleno- sis; surgical splenosis (distributing small pieces of spleen throughout the abdomen) may decrease the risk of sepsis in patients whose sple- nectomy is necessitated by trauma. However, in both these settings, the splenic tissue that regrows frequently has poor function. In addition to postsplenectomy sepsis, splenectomized patients may be at risk for thromboembolic complications, including arterial and venous thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension. These findings have been reported regardless of the underlying reason for splenectomy and the postsplenectomy platelet count. Proposed mechanisms include loss of filtering function of the spleen, allowing abnormal RBCs to remain in the circulation and activate the coagulation cascade. Portal vein throm- bosis has been reported as a complication of laparoscopic splenectomy. The etiology of pulmonary hypertension is not well understood. It has been described in chronic hemolytic conditions including thalassemia, sickle cell disease, and hereditary spherocytosis, indicating there may be a relation to ongoing chronic hemolysis postsplenectomy.

Special tests required. Technetium-­99m–labeled sulfur colloidal scintiscan Quantitation of splenic uptake of colloidal sulfur particles enables a fairly accurate static assessment of spleen function. Hypertrophy of the left hepatic lobe might be a limiting factor (this technique does not clearly show whether the mass originated in the liver or the spleen in the pres- ence of an overlapping hypertrophic left hepatic lobe). Technetium-­99m–labeled or rubidium- ­81–labeled heat-­damaged autologous erythrocyte clearance Measurement of clearance time allows a dynamic evaluation of spleen function. Preexisting erythrocyte defects, difficult erythrocyte incor- poration of the radioisotope, and false-­positive or false-­ negative results in relation to excessive or insufficient heat damage make the test not suitable for clinical practice. Detection of Howell-­Jolly bodies by staining Erythrocytes with nuclear remnants Flow cytometry No need for special equipment; inaccurate in the quanti- tation of splenic hypofunction.

Chapter 538  u  Abnormalities of Lymphatic Vessels   3065 The lymphatic system participates in many biologic processes, including fluid homeostasis, absorption of dietary fat, and ini- tiation of specific immune responses. Besides these well-­known, classical functions, several novel and unexpected physiologic and pathophysiologic functions of the lymphatics have been recently discovered, including blood pressure regulation, reverse cholesterol transport, association with metabolic diseases and obesity, and an important role in the preparation for neonatal respiration. This system includes circulating lymphocytes, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, adenoids, Peyer patches, and thymus. Lymph is an ultrafiltrate of blood and is collected by lymphatic capillaries that are present in all organs where blood flows except the bone marrow and retina. Lymphatic capillaries form progressively larger vessels that drain regions of the body. The lymphatic vessels carry lymph to the lymph nodes, where it is filtered through sinuses, particulate matter and infectious organisms are phagocytosed, and antigens are presented to surrounding lymphocytes. These actions stimulate antibody production, T-­cell responses, and cytokine secretion (see Chapter 165). Lymph is ultimately returned to the intravascular circulation. The composition of lymph can vary with the site of lymph drain- age. It is usually clear, but lymph drained from the intestinal tract may be milky (chylous) because of the presence of fats. The protein content is intermediate between an exudate and a transudate. The protein level may be increased with inflammation and in lymph drained from the liver or intestines. Lymph also contains variable numbers of lymphocytes and antigen-­presenting cells. Embryonic lymphatic development is a stepwise process that starts in the embryonic veins, where lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) progenitors are initially specified. The differentiation and maturation of these progenitors continues as they bud from the veins to produce scattered primitive lymph sacs, from which most of the lymphatic vasculature is derived. PROX1 gene expression is important to LEC specification, and studies have shown the criti- cal importance of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Wnt, Notch, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways in lymphatic system development. Little is known about the establishment of organ-­specific lym- phatics at later stages. Studies using lineage-­tracing technology suggest a venous and nonvenous origin of LECs giving rise to organ-­specific lymphatics in the mesentery, skin, and heart. Lym- phatic vessels also run parallel to the dural sinuses in the central nervous system. The embryonic origin of the meningeal lymphatics has not been determined.

Tower Section 9 The Lymphatic System LYMPHATIC MALFORMATIONS Developmental lymphatic anomalies including lymphatic malforma- tions (LMs) and complex lymphatic anomalies (CLAs) manifest as localized or multifocal lesions of the lymphatic vasculature, respec- tively (see International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies [ISSVA] classification; www.issva.org). Cystic LMs are the most common congenital lymphatic anomalies. They occur as solitary lesions of variable size that are classified as mac- rocystic, microcystic, or mixed cystic LM. LMs commonly infiltrate soft tissues and can be found anywhere on the body, although they occur more frequently on the head, neck, and axilla. CLAs are multifocal lymphatic vascular lesions involving both soft tissue and bone and often result in disruption of central collecting lym- phatic channels. They include generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA), Gorham-­Stout disease (GSD) (Fig. 538.1), kaposiform lymphan- giomatosis (KLA), and central conducting lymphatic anomalies (CCLA) (Fig. 538.2). CLAs are rare diseases with overlapping and variable clinical features. Common features include bone involvement, lymphatic leakage into the thoracic (chylous effusion) and abdomi- nal (chylous ascites) cavities and mesenteric involvement leading to protein losing enteropathy. In addition to common features, GSD is uniquely associated with progressive cortical bone loss (see Fig. 538.1). KLA can be distinguished by the presence of spindle cells on histology, an aggressive clinical course, and evidence of consumptive coagulopa- thy and hemorrhage. CCLA, or channel type anomaly is characterized by dilation, malformation, and dysfunction of the major abdominal or thoracic lymphatic vessels. LMs can also occur as combined malformations with other blood vessel types like capillaries (capillary-­lymphatic malformation) or veins (lymphatic-­venous malformation). LMs are commonly associ- ated with PIK3CA-­related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) disorders, which include Klippel-­Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), CLOVES (con- genital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, and scoliosis/skeletal/spinal anomalies) and Proteus syndrome (Fig. 538.3). Genetics Somatic, activating variants in the PIK3CA gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K are present at variable frequencies in most (80%) isolated LMs and LMs associated with PROS. These activating PIK3CA variants are identical to those found in venous malformations and in many human cancers. The genetics of CLAs are far more diverse. Activating PIK3CA gene variants have been identified in several patients diagnosed with GLA. In addition, pathologic genetic variants in genes involved in the RAS-­MAPK signaling pathway have been implicated in other CLAs. Activating NRAS gene variants are associated with KLA while two patients with GSD were found to have activating gene variants in KRAS. Somatic, pathologic genetic variants in both the ARAF and CBL genes have been found in patients diagnosed with CCLA as have inactivating germline pathogenic variants in EPHB4. The role of RAS/MAPK pathway activation in CLAs is further reinforced by the observation that patients with known RASopathies, including Noonan and Noonan-­like syndrome, can present with central conducting lymphatic anomalies.

Stagnant flow is seen in the patulous superior portion of the thoracic duct. Direct puncture of the terminal portion demonstrates marked di- lation with no spontaneous emptying. Treatment A decision to treat an LM depends on the anatomic location, involvement of local structures, and symptoms. Referral to a spe- cialized vascular anomalies clinic with the expertise to guide appropriate imaging and treatment decisions is recommended. For localized macrocystic LMs, interventional radiology (IR) admin- istration of sclerosing agents (OK432, ethanol, bleomycin) is most effective. For lesions involving skin and mucosa, laser treatments may be used. Most patients with CLAs have extensive and invasive disease, necessitating systemic therapeutic approaches. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus has had excellent effects in patients with vascular anoma- lies, including those patients with CLAs. A majority of CLA patients showed improvements in functional impairment and quality of life measures, whereas fewer showed evidence of decreased disease bur- den by imaging. Combining sirolimus with bisphosphonates may be even more effective in CLA patients with significant bone dis- ease. Alpelisib, a PIK3CA inhibitor, has been used with success in patients with PROS and in a growing number of GLA patients with a known PIK3CA pathologic variant. Small numbers of patients with KLA who were known to have pathogenic variants in either NRAS or CBL experienced clinical improvement with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. Trametinib also induced remodeling of the cen- tral lymphatics and induced symptom resolution in a patient with CCLA who had an ARAF pathogenic variant, as well a patient with Noonan syndrome and a SOS1 pathogenic variant with severe lym- phatic abnormalities. LYMPHEDEMA Lymphedema is a localized swelling caused by impaired lymphatic flow and can be primary (congenital) or acquired. Primary lymph- edemas are grouped as LMs because they result from dysgenesis of lymphatic networks during early development. Primary lymph- edema may be found in Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, autosomal dominantly inherited Milroy disease, and other chro- mosomal abnormalities. Pathologic variants in multiple genes, including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor–3 gene (VEGFR3), GJC2, PTPN14, and GATA2, are associated with primary lymphedema (www.issva.org) (Table 538.1). Autosomal recessive, dominant or de novo pathogenic variants of VEGFR3 produce Mil- roy disease. Pathologic variants in other genes are associated with specific syndromes: CCBE1 (Hennekam), FOXC2 (lymphedema distichiasis), SOX18 (hypotrichosis-­telangiectasia-­lymphedema), KMT2D/MLL2, and KDM6A (Kabuki). Unilateral or bilateral lower extremity lymphedema in an adolescent may be Meige disease. Acquired obstruction of the lymphatics is much more common than primary disorders and result from tumor, postirradiation fibrosis, and postinflammatory scarring. Filariasis is an important cause of lymph- edema in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. One third of the 120 million infected persons (primarily older adolescents and adults) have lymph- edema or a hydrocele.

Chapter 538  u  Abnormalities of Lymphatic Vessels   3065 The lymphatic system participates in many biologic processes, including fluid homeostasis, absorption of dietary fat, and ini- tiation of specific immune responses. Besides these well-­known, classical functions, several novel and unexpected physiologic and pathophysiologic functions of the lymphatics have been recently discovered, including blood pressure regulation, reverse cholesterol transport, association with metabolic diseases and obesity, and an important role in the preparation for neonatal respiration. This system includes circulating lymphocytes, lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, adenoids, Peyer patches, and thymus. Lymph is an ultrafiltrate of blood and is collected by lymphatic capillaries that are present in all organs where blood flows except the bone marrow and retina. Lymphatic capillaries form progressively larger vessels that drain regions of the body. The lymphatic vessels carry lymph to the lymph nodes, where it is filtered through sinuses, particulate matter and infectious organisms are phagocytosed, and antigens are presented to surrounding lymphocytes. These actions stimulate antibody production, T-­cell responses, and cytokine secretion (see Chapter 165). Lymph is ultimately returned to the intravascular circulation. The composition of lymph can vary with the site of lymph drain- age. It is usually clear, but lymph drained from the intestinal tract may be milky (chylous) because of the presence of fats. The protein content is intermediate between an exudate and a transudate. The protein level may be increased with inflammation and in lymph drained from the liver or intestines. Lymph also contains variable numbers of lymphocytes and antigen-­presenting cells. Embryonic lymphatic development is a stepwise process that starts in the embryonic veins, where lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) progenitors are initially specified. The differentiation and maturation of these progenitors continues as they bud from the veins to produce scattered primitive lymph sacs, from which most of the lymphatic vasculature is derived. PROX1 gene expression is important to LEC specification, and studies have shown the criti- cal importance of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Wnt, Notch, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways in lymphatic system development. Little is known about the establishment of organ-­specific lym- phatics at later stages. Studies using lineage-­tracing technology suggest a venous and nonvenous origin of LECs giving rise to organ-­specific lymphatics in the mesentery, skin, and heart. Lym- phatic vessels also run parallel to the dural sinuses in the central nervous system. The embryonic origin of the meningeal lymphatics has not been determined.

Tower Section 9 The Lymphatic System LYMPHATIC MALFORMATIONS Developmental lymphatic anomalies including lymphatic malforma- tions (LMs) and complex lymphatic anomalies (CLAs) manifest as localized or multifocal lesions of the lymphatic vasculature, respec- tively (see International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies [ISSVA] classification; www.issva.org). Cystic LMs are the most common congenital lymphatic anomalies. They occur as solitary lesions of variable size that are classified as mac- rocystic, microcystic, or mixed cystic LM. LMs commonly infiltrate soft tissues and can be found anywhere on the body, although they occur more frequently on the head, neck, and axilla. CLAs are multifocal lymphatic vascular lesions involving both soft tissue and bone and often result in disruption of central collecting lym- phatic channels. They include generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA), Gorham-­Stout disease (GSD) (Fig. 538.1), kaposiform lymphan- giomatosis (KLA), and central conducting lymphatic anomalies (CCLA) (Fig. 538.2). CLAs are rare diseases with overlapping and variable clinical features. Common features include bone involvement, lymphatic leakage into the thoracic (chylous effusion) and abdomi- nal (chylous ascites) cavities and mesenteric involvement leading to protein losing enteropathy. In addition to common features, GSD is uniquely associated with progressive cortical bone loss (see Fig. 538.1). KLA can be distinguished by the presence of spindle cells on histology, an aggressive clinical course, and evidence of consumptive coagulopa- thy and hemorrhage. CCLA, or channel type anomaly is characterized by dilation, malformation, and dysfunction of the major abdominal or thoracic lymphatic vessels. LMs can also occur as combined malformations with other blood vessel types like capillaries (capillary-­lymphatic malformation) or veins (lymphatic-­venous malformation). LMs are commonly associ- ated with PIK3CA-­related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) disorders, which include Klippel-­Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), CLOVES (con- genital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, and scoliosis/skeletal/spinal anomalies) and Proteus syndrome (Fig. 538.3). Genetics Somatic, activating variants in the PIK3CA gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K are present at variable frequencies in most (80%) isolated LMs and LMs associated with PROS. These activating PIK3CA variants are identical to those found in venous malformations and in many human cancers. The genetics of CLAs are far more diverse. Activating PIK3CA gene variants have been identified in several patients diagnosed with GLA. In addition, pathologic genetic variants in genes involved in the RAS-­MAPK signaling pathway have been implicated in other CLAs. Activating NRAS gene variants are associated with KLA while two patients with GSD were found to have activating gene variants in KRAS. Somatic, pathologic genetic variants in both the ARAF and CBL genes have been found in patients diagnosed with CCLA as have inactivating germline pathogenic variants in EPHB4. The role of RAS/MAPK pathway activation in CLAs is further reinforced by the observation that patients with known RASopathies, including Noonan and Noonan-­like syndrome, can present with central conducting lymphatic anomalies.

Stagnant flow is seen in the patulous superior portion of the thoracic duct. Direct puncture of the terminal portion demonstrates marked di- lation with no spontaneous emptying. Treatment A decision to treat an LM depends on the anatomic location, involvement of local structures, and symptoms. Referral to a spe- cialized vascular anomalies clinic with the expertise to guide appropriate imaging and treatment decisions is recommended. For localized macrocystic LMs, interventional radiology (IR) admin- istration of sclerosing agents (OK432, ethanol, bleomycin) is most effective. For lesions involving skin and mucosa, laser treatments may be used. Most patients with CLAs have extensive and invasive disease, necessitating systemic therapeutic approaches. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus has had excellent effects in patients with vascular anoma- lies, including those patients with CLAs. A majority of CLA patients showed improvements in functional impairment and quality of life measures, whereas fewer showed evidence of decreased disease bur- den by imaging. Combining sirolimus with bisphosphonates may be even more effective in CLA patients with significant bone dis- ease. Alpelisib, a PIK3CA inhibitor, has been used with success in patients with PROS and in a growing number of GLA patients with a known PIK3CA pathologic variant. Small numbers of patients with KLA who were known to have pathogenic variants in either NRAS or CBL experienced clinical improvement with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor. Trametinib also induced remodeling of the cen- tral lymphatics and induced symptom resolution in a patient with CCLA who had an ARAF pathogenic variant, as well a patient with Noonan syndrome and a SOS1 pathogenic variant with severe lym- phatic abnormalities. LYMPHEDEMA Lymphedema is a localized swelling caused by impaired lymphatic flow and can be primary (congenital) or acquired. Primary lymph- edemas are grouped as LMs because they result from dysgenesis of lymphatic networks during early development. Primary lymph- edema may be found in Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, autosomal dominantly inherited Milroy disease, and other chro- mosomal abnormalities. Pathologic variants in multiple genes, including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor–3 gene (VEGFR3), GJC2, PTPN14, and GATA2, are associated with primary lymphedema (www.issva.org) (Table 538.1). Autosomal recessive, dominant or de novo pathogenic variants of VEGFR3 produce Mil- roy disease. Pathologic variants in other genes are associated with specific syndromes: CCBE1 (Hennekam), FOXC2 (lymphedema distichiasis), SOX18 (hypotrichosis-­telangiectasia-­lymphedema), KMT2D/MLL2, and KDM6A (Kabuki). Unilateral or bilateral lower extremity lymphedema in an adolescent may be Meige disease. Acquired obstruction of the lymphatics is much more common than primary disorders and result from tumor, postirradiation fibrosis, and postinflammatory scarring. Filariasis is an important cause of lymph- edema in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Lymph node enlargement can be caused by prolifera- tion of normal lymphoid elements or by infiltration with malignant or other phagocytic cells. In most patients, a careful history and a com- plete physical examination suggest the proper diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS What Is the Site of the Mass? The differential diagnosis of a mass varies greatly based on anatomic location. Although pathologic masses can occur in any site, masses occurring in the supraclavicular and lower half of the neck are more likely to reflect pathologic lymphadenopathy than in other sites of the body. Is the Mass a Lymph Node? Nonlymphoid masses (cervical rib, thyroglossal cyst, branchial cleft cyst or infected sinus, cystic hygroma, goiter, thyroiditis, sternomastoid muscle tumor of infancy, neurofibroma) occur frequently in the neck and less often in other areas. Is the Node Enlarged? Lymph nodes are not usually palpable in the newborn. With antigenic exposure, lymphoid tissue increases in volume. They are not con- sidered enlarged until their diameter exceeds 1 cm for cervical and axillary nodes, 1.5 cm for inguinal nodes, and epitrochlear >0.5 cm. Other lymph nodes usually are not palpable or visualized with plain radiographs. What are the Characteristics of the Node? Acutely infected nodes are usually tender. There may also be erythema and warmth of the overlying skin. Fluctuance suggests abscess forma- tion. Tuberculous nodes may be matted. With chronic infection, many of these signs are not present. A firm, fixed, nonmobile (to adjacent or underlying tissues), nontender node should always raise the question of malignancy, regardless of the presence or absence of systemic symp- toms or other abnormal physical findings. Tumors or tumor-­involved nodes are often present for >2 weeks and may be associated with local extension (voice change, dysphagia, otalgia) or systemic signs (fever, weight loss, night sweats). Is the Lymphadenopathy Localized or Generalized? Generalized adenopathy (enlargement of >2 noncontiguous node regions) is caused by systemic disease (Table 539.1) and is often accom- panied by abnormal physical findings in other systems. In contrast, regional adenopathy is most frequently the result of infection in the involved node and/or its drainage area (Table 539.2). When caused by infectious agents other than bacteria, adenopathy may be character- ized by atypical anatomic areas, a prolonged course, a draining sinus, lack of prior pyogenic infection, and unusual clues in the history (cat scratches, tuberculosis exposure, venereal disease). The histopatho- logic pattern may also help with a differential diagnosis (Table 539.3). TREATMENT Evaluation and treatment of lymphadenopathy is guided by the prob- able etiologic factor, as determined from the history and physical examination. Many patients with cervical adenopathy have a history compatible with viral infection and are observed without interven- tion. If bacterial infection is suspected, antibiotic treatment covering at least streptococci and staphylococci is indicated. Those who do not respond to oral antibiotics, as demonstrated by persistent swelling and fever, require intravenous (IV) antistaphylococcal antibiotics. If there is no response in 1-­2 days, or if there are signs of airway obstruction or significant toxicity, ultrasound, CT, or MRI of the neck with con- trast should be obtained. If pus is present, it may be aspirated, or if it is extensive, it may require incision and drainage. Gram stain and cul- ture of the pus should be obtained. The sizes of involved nodes should be documented before treatment. Failure to decrease in size within 14 days also suggests the need for further evaluation. This evaluation may include a complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential; Epstein-­ Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma, and Bartonella henselae titers; anti–streptolysin O or anti-­DNase B serologic tests; tuberculin skin test or gamma interferon assay; and chest radiograph to evalu- ate for mediastinal adenopathy. If these are not diagnostic, consulta- tion with an infectious diseases or oncology specialist may be helpful. Biopsy should be considered if there is persistent or unexplained fever, weight loss, night sweats, supraclavicular location, mediastinal mass, hard nodes, or fixation of the nodes to surrounding tissues. Biopsy may also be indicated if there is an increase in size over baseline in 2 weeks, no decrease in size in 4-­6 weeks, no regression to “normal” in 8-­12 weeks, or if new signs and symptoms develop.

Hard, nontender, nonerythematous nodes involving multiple regions (including mediastinum and abdomen), hepatic or splenic enlargement, fever, night sweats, and weight loss suggest malignancy or a granulomatous process. Persistence of symptoms and lymphade- nopathy >2 weeks and certain locations (supraclavicular, mediastinal, abdominal) also suggest malignancy. Cytopenias and elevated blood lactate dehydrogenase are associated with malignancy and certain infectious and inflammatory disorders. Ultrasound is useful in distin- guishing malignancy from reactive nodes. CT with contrast is helpful in identifying other affected nodes and organs. Although fine needle aspiration (FNA) is sometimes used as an initial approach to diagnosis, excisional biopsies are often needed and are the preferred diagnostic approach to fully appreciate the lymph node architecture and genomic profiling when malignant conditions are being considered.

Tower Kikuchi-­Fujimoto disease is a rare, usually self-­limiting disease that is seen in all ethnic groups; children and adults may be affected. Familial cases have been reported. The etiology is unknown, although infectious and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been associated. The differential diagnosis includes infectious lymphadenitis, lymphoma, tuberculosis, and SLE. Presentation is varied but most often presents as firm, painful uni- lateral posterior cervical adenopathy evolving over several weeks. Fever is frequently reported. Labs are often normal; however, elevated eryth- rocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated CRP, atypical lymphocytosis, and leukopenia can be seen. Nodes range in size from 0.5-­6.0 cm, are painful or tender in only 50% of cases, may be multiple, and must be differentiated from lymphoma. Node involvement may occasionally be bilateral or rarely present in axillary, supraclavicular, or intraabdominal lymph nodes. Ultrasound usually shows multiple conglomerated, uni- lateral cervical lymphadenopathy with perinodal fat swelling and even size distribution. Aseptic meningitis is an uncommon associated feature. The diagnosis is made by lymph node biopsy. Histologic features include paracortical lymph node expansion with patchy, well-­circumscribed areas of necrosis showing karyorrhexis, an absence of neutrophils and eosino- phils, a CD68+/MPO+ histiocytic infiltrate, and CD123+/TCL1+ plasma- cytoid dendritic cells. Kikuchi-­Fujimoto disease usually resolves within 6 months, although relapses have occurred up to 16 years later. Treatment is typically symptomatic including rest and analgesics. Therapy with sys- temic steroids is reserved for patients with severe symptoms. Recurrences occur in ∼5-20% depending on site (higher recurrences with bone, CNS, or skin involvement). Patients should be followed for the possible develop- ment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Rarely, the disease has been fatal.

It can be sporadic or associated with inherited conditions. Some patients have somatic pathogenic variants in NRAS, KRAS, and MAP2K1. Familial RDD has been noted in patients with pathogenic variants in SLC29A3. RDD may coexist with SLE, JIA, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Patients can be classified as classical (nodal) RDD or extranodal RDD. Classical RDD patients present with massive bilateral, painless, mobile cervical adenopathy with or without fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Other lymph node involvement can include mediastinal, axillary, and inguinal, although retroperitoneal involvement is rare. Extranodal RDD occurs in 43% of cases. Soft tissue involvement has been reported in many organ systems. The most common sites are the skin, followed by the nasal cavity and sinuses, palate, orbit, bone, and central nervous system. Lab abnormalities can include normocytic anemia, leukocyto- sis (typically neutrophilia), elevated ESR, and polyclonal elevation of immunoglobulin G (hypergammaglobulinemia). Initial imaging stud- ies are determined by symptoms and sites of suspected disease. A biopsy that demonstrates histiocytes with hypochromatic nuclei with pale cytoplasm containing engulfed erythrocytes, plasma cells, and lymphocytes (emperipolesis), and immunoreactivity to S100 protein, in conjunction with expected clinical features, is diagnostic. IgG4-­positive cells are often abundant. Occasionally, autoantibodies to erythrocytes or synovium may be present. The differential diagnosis includes Lang- erhans cell histiocytosis, myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoma, and hyper-­IgG4 syndrome. After diagnosis, whole-­body imaging with MRI or PET scan is recommended to evaluate for extranodal RDD. Observation alone is a reasonable treatment choice for patients with uncomplicated nodal/cutaneous disease, as spontaneous remissions are seen in 20–50% of these patients. Symptomatic patients may benefit from surgical resection or debulking with the presence of single-­site disease. Systemic therapy is typically reserved for severe, refractory, multifocal, or unresectable disease. Steroids are helpful in reducing nodal size; how- ever, durable responses are often not seen with steroids alone. Various immunomodulatory (sirolimus) and chemotherapy regimens have been used successfully in severe disease, with treatment courses ranging from 6-­12 months followed by close observation. Targeted therapies, includ- ing MEK inhibitors, have shown promising early results with studies ongoing. Radiation therapy has modest efficacy in RDD but has been used successfully in emergent therapy with visual or airway compromise. RDD may recur for many years with an unpredictable clinical course.

Graff and Richard L. Tower Castleman disease (CD) is an uncommon nonmalignant B-­cell lymphoproliferative disorder and is also called angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia. CD causes lymph node enlargement and is classified as either unicentric (involving a single lymph node or lymph node region) or multicentric (involving multiple lymph node regions). Unicentric CD typically presents with enlargement of a single bulky lymph node, most often in the mediastinum, neck, or abdomen, which can be asymptomatic or present with locally com- pressive symptoms. Patients may have fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. Diagnosis is made by an excisional lymph node biopsy. Staging imaging is performed with CT scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis or PET-­CT scan to evaluate for multicentric disease. Management includes surgical resection when possible and is associated with a benign course, although patients should be educated on an increased risk of lymphoma. Multicentric CD is subclassified based on the etiologic driver of the disease, either human herpes virus-­8 (HHV-­8), peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, or idiopathic. An underlying immu- nocompromised state is the primary risk factor for HHV-­8 CD, par- ticularly patients with HIV. Other forms of multicentric CD have no known risk factors. HHV-­8 and idiopathic multicentric CD are driven by the excessive production of interleukin-­6 (IL-­6). Lymphadenopathy is often small volume and is present in peripheral and central lymph node chains. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss are more common at presentation compared to uni- centric CD. Fluid collections including ascites, cytopenias, and liver/ kidney dysfunction are also seen and indicate more aggressive disease. Diagnosis is again made by excisional lymph node biopsy as well as consistent clinical features. To determine type of multicentric CD, testing for HIV, HHV-­8, and evaluation for POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, edema/endocrinopathy, monoclonal-­protein, skin) syndrome is needed. Serum inflammatory markers are often tested at baseline and used to track disease. The differential diagnosis is broad even after lymph node biopsy, including infection, autoimmune dis- ease, and malignancy. There is no standard treatment for multicentric Castleman disease. For symptomatic HHV-­8+ multicentric CD, ritux- imab +/-­ etoposide with antiretroviral therapy for HIV+ patients have achieved excellent relapse-­free survival. Idiopathic multicentric CD is managed with anti-­IL-­6 directed therapy (siltuximab) and steroids. Even after initial responses, symptoms can return after stopping therapy. Rituximab, steroids, and additional immunomodulatory medications (particularly the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus) are used next in patients that have had an inadequate response to therapy. Cytotoxic chemother- apy can be used for severe disease with organ dysfunction after failure of first-­line therapy. TAFRO (thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulum fibrosis, organomegaly) syndrome is thought to be a subtype of multicentric Castleman disease based on the histologic appearance of the lymph node. Although there are overlapping features, TAFRO may be a dis- tinct entity (Fig. 539.1). Visit Elsevier eBooks+ at eBooks.Health.Elsevier.com for Bibliography.
