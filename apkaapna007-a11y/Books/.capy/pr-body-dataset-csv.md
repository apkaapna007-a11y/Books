This PR adds `dataset.csv` containing rows aligned with the `public.nelson_book_contents` schema (excluding id/embedding/timestamps which are set by DB defaults).

Columns in CSV
- meta (jsonb string)
- index_path
- title
- topic
- subtopic
- content
- summary
- chunk_no

Details
- 26 rows generated from the uploaded chapter text files
- One row per source file (chunk_no = 1); embeddings intentionally left NULL
- Summaries are brief extracts from the start of each file for quick preview

Next steps
- Optionally enable pgvector and create `embedding vector(1536)` column if not present
- If chunking is preferred, we can add a follow-up PR with chunks.csv
