This PR switches the embedding workflow to a free Hugging Face model and aligns the schema.

Changes
- scripts/requirements_hf.txt — sentence-transformers, torch, psycopg, dotenv
- scripts/compute_embeddings_hf.py — uses `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-d) by default, batches through NULL embeddings, updates `embedding`
- scripts/validate_similarity_hf.py — embeds a query via HF and returns top-10 by vector distance
- scripts/README_HF.md — setup and usage
- sql/pgvector_switch_to_384.sql — drops `embedding` and re-adds as `vector(384)`

Notes
- 384-d vectors are widely used with HF models for fast, strong retrieval
- If you prefer 768-d (e.g., `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`), adjust the column to `vector(768)` and set `HF_MODEL`
- No data loss expected (embedding column was not populated yet)

Next steps
1) Apply `sql/pgvector_switch_to_384.sql` to your DB
2) `pip install -r scripts/requirements_hf.txt`
3) Run `scripts/compute_embeddings_hf.py`
4) Validate with `scripts/validate_similarity_hf.py "asthma corticosteroid"`
